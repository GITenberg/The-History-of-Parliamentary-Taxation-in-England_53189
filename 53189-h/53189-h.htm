<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">This</span> is the second volume in the series of
“David A. Wells Prize Essays” established
under the provisions of the bequest of the late
David A. Wells. The subject for competition
is announced in the spring of each year and
essays may be submitted by members of the
senior class in Williams College and by graduates
of not more than three years’ standing.
By the terms of the will of the founder the following
limitation is imposed: “No subject
shall be selected for competitive writing or investigation
and no essay shall be considered
which in any way advocates or defends the
spoliation of property under form or process
of law; or the restriction of Commerce in times
of peace by Legislation, except for moral or
sanitary purposes; or the enactment of usury
laws; or the impairment of contracts by the
debasement of coin; or the issue and use by
Government of irredeemable notes or promises
to pay intended to be used as currency and as
a substitute for money; or which defends the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
endowment of such ‘paper,’ ‘notes’ and
‘promises to pay’ with the legal tender
quality.”</p>

<p>The first essay, published in 1905, was
“The Contributions of the Landed Man to
Civil Liberty,” by Elwin Lawrence Page.
The subject of the following essay was announced
in 1906 by the late Henry Loomis
Nelson, then David A. Wells Professor of Political
Science. As first framed it read, “The
Origin and Growth of the Power of the English
National Council and Parliament to Levy
Taxes, from the Time of the Norman Conquest
to the Enactment of the Bill of Rights;
Together with a Statement of the Constitutional
Law of the United States Governing
Taxation.” Mr. Nelson subsequently eliminated
the last clause, thus restricting the field
of the essay to English Constitutional History.
The prize was awarded in 1907. Since the
death of Mr. Nelson in 1908, the task of editing
the successful essay has been given to the
undersigned in coöperation with the author.</p>

<p>In publishing this volume occasion is taken
to state the purpose of the competition. Since
it is confined to students and graduates of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
college which offers no post-graduate instruction,
it is not intended to require original historical
research but rather to encourage a
thoughtful handling of problems in political
science.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> a chapter of Hall’s Chronicle having to do
with the mid-reign history of Henry VIII occurs
an instance of popular protest against
arbitrary taxation. The people are complaining
against the Commissions, says the Chronicler,
bodies appointed by the Crown to levy
taxes without consent of Parliament. “For
thei saied,” so goes the passage, “if men
should geue their goodes by a Commission,
then wer it worse than the taxes of Fraunce,
and so England should be bond and not free.”
Hall’s naïve statement is scarcely less than a
declaration of the axiomatic principle of politics
that self-taxation is an essential of self-government.</p>

<p>Writers on the evolution of the taxing power
are inclined to go a step farther and believe
that the liberty of a nation can be gauged
most readily by the power of the people over
the public purse. With a view so extended a
narrative of the growth of popular control in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
England might easily expand into a history of
the English Constitution. In the present essay,
however, an effort has been made to exclude
all matters which were not of the strictest
pertinency to the subject in hand. Feudal
dues and incidents, the machinery of taxation,
the Exchequer, the forces accounting for the
shifting composition of the national assemblies,
these and other matters have been
treated of in outline rather than in detail, because
they appeared to lie beyond the scope of
this essay.</p>

<p>Only two matters have been taken to be of
first rate importance,&mdash;the tax and the authority
by which it was laid. Taxation has
been construed broadly as being any contribution
levied by the government for its own support.
An endeavor has been made in each
instance to find out who or what the taxing
authority was, and whether the tax was laid
in accordance with it. Under the Normans
the taxing authority was unmistakably the
king, and by the Bill of Rights it lay as unmistakably
in Parliament, with the right of
initiation in the House of Commons. The
story of the shift from one position to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
forms, of course, the major burden of the
essay.</p>

<p>At the time when the subject was assigned,
the power of the House of Commons over
money bills had not been brought into question
for more than two centuries, and the first
drafts had been written and the prize awarded
before the Asquith ministry was confronted
with the problem of interference by the House
of Lords. At this writing the question has not
been settled. It has seemed advisable therefore
to leave the essay within the bounds originally
set for it, and what connection it has
with the events of 1909 and 1910 consists
chiefly in its consideration of the basic principles
involved in that struggle.</p>

<p>To the late Henry Loomis Nelson, David
A. Wells Professor of Political Science in
Williams College, I owe the interest I have
had in the preparation of this book. It is an
outgrowth of his course in English Constitutional
history, and some of the interpretations
placed upon events are his interpretations.
His death intervened before the second draft
of the book was made, and the revisory work
had to be done without his suggestions. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
my friend, Dr. Theodore Clarke Smith, Professor
in Williams College, I am indebted for a
painstaking examination of the manuscript
and for much valuable advice in the work preliminary
to publication. Acknowledgments
in the footnotes to Bishop Stubbs, Mr. Medley,
Mr. Taswell-Langmead and many others
scarcely manifest my obligations. But the essay
throughout is based upon original authorities.</p>

<p class="pch">THE SAXONS: CUSTOMARY REVENUES AND
EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS</p>


<div class="sidenote">Evolutionary
character
of the
English
Constitution</div>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> English Constitution looks ever backward.
Precedent lies behind precedent, law
behind law, until fact shades off into legend
and that into a common beginning, the Germanic
character. Standing upon the eminence
of 1689, one sees the Petition of Right,
and then in deepening perspective, Confirmatio
Cartarum and Magna Carta. The crisis of
1215 points to the Charter of Henry I, and
behind that are the good laws of Edward the
Confessor. The Anglo-Saxon polity looks
back of the era of Alfred, to the times when
Hengist and Horsa were yet unborn, and the
German tribesmen were still living in their
forests beyond the Rhine without thinking
of migrating westward. And there, behind
the habits of those barbaric ancestors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Englishmen, lies the national character, the
Anglo-Saxon sense of right and wrong, of
loyalty, justice, and duty. The growth of
the English Constitution has been as subject
to the laws of evolution as the development
of man himself. The germ of national character
evolved habits of thought and action,
and these habits, or as they are better termed,
institutions, were beaten upon by conditions
and fused with the institutions of another
people, until at last they took on the shape of
free government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early ideas
of taxation</div>

<p>An account of the advance toward the laying
of taxes by representatives of the people
must begin with some notice of the idea of
taxation which actuated the German tribesmen.
Tacitus writing of them as they were
at the beginning of the Second Century A. D.
makes this remark:<span class="sidenote">Amongst
the
Germans</span> “It is customary amongst
the states to bestow on the chiefs by voluntary
and individual contribution a present
of cattle or of fruits, which, while accepted as
a compliment, supplies their wants.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>then, is the earliest idea of a tax, a voluntary
contribution for the support of the <i>princeps</i>.
It was prompted by the essentially personal
relationship existent between people and chieftain,
the sense of attachment of the people to
the leader. Direct taxation laid by the <i>princeps</i>
upon the tribe, was as unknown in Germany
as it was foreign to the Germanic spirit.</p>

<p>When the conquering Saxons, therefore,
swept westward across the German Ocean,
they carried with them scarcely more than a
semblance of taxation. Between men and
leader the personal relationship still subsisted,
but as time went on, the Anglo-Saxon king
became less the father of the people, and
more their lord.<span class="sidenote">Amongst
the Anglo-Saxons</span> Lord of the national land he
was as well, but he did not rule by reason of
that fact. The two claims upon popular support
were therefore distinct, the one as personal
leader, the other as lord of the national land;
and during the major part of the Anglo-Saxon
era they afforded a sufficient means
for the maintenance of the king and his government.
Until the moment of a supreme
emergency the king did not have to seek extraordinary
sources of income.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>As lord of the national land, the king had a
double source of revenue. The folkland, or
land subject to national regulation<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
<span class="sidenote">Revenue of
the Anglo-Saxon
kings</span> alienable only by the consent of the Witenagemot,
presented the king with its proceeds,
much of which went for the maintenance of
the royal armed retainers and servants. Deducible
from this right to the public lands,
was the claim of the king to tolls, duties, and
customs accruing from the harbors, landing-places,
and military roads of the realm, and
to treasure-trove. Aside from this, the king
was one of the largest private landowners in
the kingdom, and from it he derived rents and
profits which were disposable at will.</p>

<p>The other sources of the royal revenue,
which at least in the beginning may be said
to have accrued to the king by reason of
personal obligation, were the military, the
judicial, and the police powers. By reason of
the military power vested in him, the king
could demand the services of all freemen to
fulfill the <i>trinoda necessitas</i>,&mdash;service in the
militia, repair of bridges, and the maintenance
of fortifications. Further, in accordance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>with the system of vassalage incident
to his military power, he had the right of
<i>heriot</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> according to which the armor of a
deceased vassal became the property of the
king. The judicial authority, also, was a
fruitful source of income; from it the king
adduced a right to property forfeited in consequence
of treason, theft, or similar crimes,
and to the fines which were payable upon
every breach of the law. The third great
power vested in the royal person was the
police control; under it the king turned to
account the privilege of market by reserving
to himself certain payments; also the protection
offered to Jews and merchants was
paid for, and the king pocketed the bulk of
the tribute. Beyond these,&mdash;and here we
have the analogy of the later royal claim to
purveyance,&mdash;the districts through which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>the king passed or those traversed by messengers
upon the king’s business, lay under
obligation to supply sustenance throughout
the extent of the royal sojourn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danegeld,
991</div>

<p>It is apparent that an extraordinary occasion
had to arise before this large ordinary
revenue should prove to be inadequate to
meet all reasonable royal necessities. The
whole matter is shrouded in obscurity, yet
it is unlikely that this extraordinary occasion
arrived before the onslaught of the Danes.
There is no record of an earlier instance.</p>

<p>It was in 991<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that the Saxon army under
Brihtnoth, Ealdorman of the East Saxons,
suffered decisive defeat at the hands of Danish
pirates. King Ethelred the Unready
found himself at the mercy of foreign enemies,
and his only recourse was bribery. Under
this necessity, a levy<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of £10,000 was made,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>and secured momentary peace from the truculent
Danes. But it was only momentary;
they returned in 994 and took away £16,000.
They repeated, under various pretexts, their
profitable incursions in 1002, 1007, and 1011.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
In 1012, having been bought off for the last
time, the Danes entered English pay, and the
Danegeld instead of being an extraordinary
charge, became a regularly recurrent tax.
It continued until 1051, when Edward the
Confessor succeeded in paying off the last of
the Danish ships.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The chronicler<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> accounts
for the abolition of the Danegeld after the
manner of his time. Edward the Confessor,
so goes the story, entered his treasure-house
one day to find the Devil sitting amongst the
money bags. It so happened that the wealth
which was being thus guarded was that which
had accrued from a recent levy of the Danegeld.
To the pious Confessor the sight was
sufficient to demonstrate the evil of the tax
and he straightway abolished it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Authority
for the
Danegeld</div>

<p>But the history of the origin of the Danegeld
and the mythical tale of its abolition are
of trifling importance as compared with the
authority whereby the impost was laid. In
991 it was apparently the Witenagemot,
acting upon the advice of the Archbishop
Sigeric, which issued the decree levying the
tax.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Three years later it was “King Ethelred
by the advice of his chief men” who promised
the Danes tribute.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Similarly in 1002,
1007, and 1011 it is Ethelred “cum consilio
primatum” who fixes the amount of money
to be raised.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The deduction is not hard to make: it was
at least usual if indeed it was not felt to be a
necessity for the king to take counsel with the
Witenagemot before he went about the preliminaries
of taxation. It is not unlikely, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>that in practice the assent of the Witan was
less or more of a formality varying according
to the weakness or strength of the king. A
strong king’s will would dominate the Witan,
whereas a weak king would be subservient to
its desires and interest.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a clear comprehension
of the taxing power of the Witan as compared
with that subsequently exercised by the English
Parliament, <span class="sidenote">The Witenagemot
and its
powers</span> it is essential that one understands
the make-up of the Anglo-Saxon body.
As its name implies, the Witan was an assembly
of the wise. Its organization was not
based upon the ownership of land, nor was
there any rule held to undeviatingly which prescribed
qualifications for membership. Generally
speaking it was composed of the king and
his family, who were known as the Athelings;
the national officers, both ecclesiastical and
civil, a group which included the bishops and
abbots, the ealdormen or chief men of the
shires, and the ministri or administrative officers;
and finally, the royal nominees, men
who are not comprehensible in the above
classes, but who recommended themselves
to the king by reason of unusual or expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
knowlege.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is observable, then, that this
assembly was by the nature of its composition
aristocratic. That it was not representative
in the modern sense of the term is as readily
apparent. With certain restrictions the official
members&mdash;the bishops, ealdormen, the
ministri&mdash;were coöpted by the existing members,
while the remainder were either present
by right of birth or invited to attend by reason
of peculiar attainment. Nevertheless, the
Witenagemot was commonly believed to be
capable of expressing the national will. It
had the power of electing the king and the
complementary power of deposition, and exercised
every power of government, making
laws, administering them, adjudging cases
arising under them, and levying taxes for
the public need.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Such in brief was the body which in 991
assented to the levy of the Danegeld. The
act was of great importance; by it the Witan
both exercised a right which was not to be
vindicated in its completeness for the space of
seven hundred years, but it laid a trap for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>those who, in the time of Charles the First,
should be struggling for the attainment of that
right, for in their action lay the precedent
which the Stuart lawyers should warp into a
pretext for the levy of ship-money.</p>

<p class="pch">FEUDAL AND ROYAL TAXATION<br />
THE NORMAN AND THE ANGEVIN KINGS<br />
1066-1215</p>


<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
Norman
Rule</div>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Under</span> the Saxon kings the structure of government
was only half built. The foundation,
laid in the shire and hundred moots,
the townships, and the incidental organisms
of local government, was solid and capable
of upholding a heavy superstructure. But
the Saxons scarcely built further. They left
to the Norman kings, peculiarly fitted to
their work by temperament and habit, the
task of setting up a strong central government.
The price which the nation paid for it was
the loss of what right it had possessed of
assenting to taxation.</p>

<p>During the whole period from the coming
of the Normans in 1066 to the signing of
Magna Carta in 1215 there can be brought
forward only two or three instances of assent
by the National Council to taxes levied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
king, and these few instances are at best
equivocal. They are insufficient to justify
the belief that the National Council had any
final power over the levying of taxation. But
the period is not altogether gray; it concludes
with the enunciation in Magna Carta of
rights which cast a halo of color over the whole
subsequent narrative of the struggle for parliamentary
taxation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
the
Conqueror
1066-1087</div>

<p>William the Conqueror was precisely the
man most likely to exercise supreme control
over taxation. Elected to the kingship according
to the Saxon forms and with his title to
the crown backed up by force of arms, he
created a system of government of which he
himself was the center and in which his
authority, even to the vassals of vassals, was
supreme.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> With his thirst for power thus satisfied
he was given a free hand to indulge his
besetting sin of avarice. Small wonder was it
therefore that he clung to the revenues of his
predecessors and added new imposts of his
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the absolutist
character of the king, William retained
the theory and for the most part the form of
the Saxon Witan. Never, however, did the
Norman assemblies exercise independent legislative
or executive functions.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The holding
of land,<span class="sidenote">His
National
Council</span>
 as a prerequisite to membership in
the National Council, was under William an
uncertain factor; the membership continued
to include, generally speaking, the same officers,
ecclesiastics, and nobles as composed
the Witenagemot. The powers of this assembly
were probably not great; at any rate,
the magnates of the period considered attendance
not as a right or a privilege or
even as an advantage, but merely as a necessary
duty toward the royal person. The king
consulted the magnates on almost every piece
of legislation, and stated in the subsequent
promulgation of the laws that he had obtained
their advice. But in the case of a strong king,
such as was the Conqueror, the consultation
must have been scarcely more than a statement
of the royal will and a formal acquiescence.
The holding of these assemblies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>took place at the crowning days of the king,
at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, generally
in London, Winchester, and Gloucester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its part
in taxation</div>

<p>In the matter of taxation, it is probable as
in the case of other legislation that the Conqueror
advised with his Council, though the
evidence pointing toward such a conclusion
is entirely of a later date. But in so far as
practical advantage to the payers of the taxes
was concerned, the power might quite as
well have lain solely in the hands of the king;
if indeed the Conqueror did secure the assent
of the Council, it was no more than an instance
of his policy of adhering to the forms
of law while making the practices under it
serve his own purposes. The reimposition in
1084 of the Danegeld which William revived
as an occasional instead of a regular tax, is
not stated by the chronicler as receiving assent
from the Council; the king is said to have
“received six shillings from every hide.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Roger of Wendover’s Chronicle of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>year brands this exaction as an “extortion,”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
by which we are scarcely to understand a
tax granted in any modern sense by the chief
legislative body of the kingdom.<span class="sidenote">Instance of
the
Danegeld,
1084</span> The Saxon
Chronicler speaking of the same imposition
says, “The king caused a great and heavy
tax to be raised throughout England, even
seventy-two pence on every hide of land.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The amount of such an impost, if drawn from
two-thirds of the hidage of the kingdom, would
be a sum approximating £20,000.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is unlikely
that an exaction of so great magnitude
could have been levied without the assent of
the Council if the Conqueror was under any
obligation to obtain their consent or even
their advice; and it is still more unlikely that
four chroniclers of the events of that year
should have let pass unnoted a vote of assent
if it had been passed by the National Council.
We are therefore to conclude that either the
Conqueror levied the tax without consulting
his Council at all, or that he did consult them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>and that their assent was of so formal and
valueless a nature as not to deserve notice
in the records of the year.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Domesday
Survey,
1086</div>

<p>The year 1086 witnessed the Domesday
Survey. By it William obtained a detailed
register of the land and its capacity for taxation.
To the administrative side of taxation
the Survey is of supreme importance, since
the valuation of land thus arrived at was
never entirely superseded as a definite and
fair basis for the laying of taxes; to the actual
granting of the tax, however, its importance
is of much less degree. In such light the interest
centers chiefly on the fact that representatives
were elected from every hundred
upon whose sworn depositions the information
that William wanted was obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
Rufus,
1087-1100</div>

<p>The unlucky thirteen years of the reign of
William Rufus, who succeeded to the throne
upon the death of the Conqueror in 1087,
are almost negligible in considering the progress
toward parliamentary taxation. William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Rufus, or more particularly his brilliant and
perverted justiciar, Ranulf Flambard, determined
upon the profitable program of getting
together as much money as possible by whatever
means seemed most convenient. In the
nature of things the church and the great
feudatories were the most available sources
for extortion and toward them Flambard
chiefly directed his energies. He did not,
however, overlook the Danegeld and he seems
to have levied it with perfect absolutism. The
chronicler Florence gives an instance of the
petty extortion which the justiciar practiced
upon the people. Flambard was in the habit
of enforcing military service from the shires.
On one occasion, so says Florence, he met the
array, informed the militiamen that there was
no necessity for their appearance, and then
proceeded to mulct them of the ten shillings
which their shires had given to each by way
of providing for their maintenance.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Against
plunderings of that sort the people were too
weak and too disunited to make resistance.
In such a reign, with one side unwilling to
progress and the other unable, it is apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>that no steps could be taken toward the granting
of taxes by a responsible body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry I,
1100-1135</div>

<p>The reign of Henry I is of greater importance,
not only because of the long forward
strides which the king and his justiciar Roger
of Salisbury took in the direction of judicial
and financial organization, but because we
find in the records of his time certain pieces
of evidence which seem to support the contention
that the Council gave some measure
of consent to taxation. The former is palpably
beyond the scope of this essay, but the
latter is more pertinent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
Charter</div>

<p>The first of these instances is the eleventh
section of the Charter of Liberties which
Henry I issued at the moment of his accession.
The significant passage is this: “To those
knights who hold their lands by the cuirass,
of my own gift I grant the lands of their
demesne ploughs free from all payments
and all labor.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The king goes on to state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>the reason; it was “so they may readily provide
themselves with horses and arms for my
service and for the defense of my kingdom.”
The relief thus granted was by way of protection
against the extortionate demands which
Ranulf Flambard had laid upon the lands of
vassals in the time of William Rufus. But
Henry did not grant the liberty freely out of
hand. He appended the clause that for his
service and the defense of the kingdom, the
vassals should supply themselves with horses
and arms. Thus remotely and in effect
rather than in fact did the Charter touch upon
taxation. It contained no reference to assent
by the vassals, either individually or in the
National Council. In accordance with the
feudal theory of individual contribution for
the support of the lord, and in view of the
provision in the Charter against payments,
the inference can be drawn that individual
assent would be in order. But to find an
answer to the question as to where the collective
assent of the barons was obtained, if
at all, one must look further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Question of
assent to
taxation</div>

<p>In a letter addressed to “Samson the Bishop
and Urso d’Abitat,” who were respectively the
bishop of the diocese and the sheriff of the
county of Worcester, Henry says, in speaking
of the county courts, “I will cause those
courts to be summoned when I will for my
own proper necessities at my pleasure.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
That these county courts were utilized by the
Norman kings for purposes of extortion, is
attested by the reluctance of the suitors to
attend their sessions,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and in the light of that
fact, the “proper necessities” of the king are
apparently none other than the royal need
for money. But why, if the assent of the
taxed was not required, should the courts be
summoned to meet the “proper necessities”
of the crown? <span class="sidenote">In the
Shire
Moots</span> Would that purpose be subserved
merely by making a demand for money?
Had that been the fact, the courts might well
have been left to carry on their peculiar
functions untroubled, for extortion can be
the more readily practiced king to man than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>king to people. The conclusion is reasonable,
notwithstanding the very large part which
conjecture plays in it, that some form of
assent was usual in the county courts in response
to the royal demands.</p>

<p>But there is another piece of evidence which
points to the National Council itself giving
assent to taxation. In the Chronicle of the
Monastery of Abingdon occurs a quotation of
an order from Henry to his officers exempting
the lands of a certain abbot from the payment
of an “aid which my barons have
given me.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Whether or not this statement
can be taken as substantiating the theory of
assent depends upon a point of time; was the
gift of the barons before or after the laying of
the tax?<span class="sidenote">In the
National
Council</span> If the gift was indeed prior to the
levy, then the evidence is conclusive that the
barons assented to taxation; if, on the other
hand, the barons gave the aid after the levy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>had been made, the statement refers solely
to the actual payment of the tax. The tense
of the Latin verb, however, and the circumstances
in which the king writes, seem to
point to the former alternative; Henry directs
that the Exchequer exempt the abbot’s lands
from the collection of an aid, not which the
barons were giving him, but which they have
given him. It is possible to infer, then, that
sometimes, at least, the barons formally
assented to the levying of an extraordinary
aid.</p>

<p>But this assent must not be taken as proof
that the barons discussed taxation in formal
session or that they had any generally recognized
power of choice. None of the records
of the time, though they speak emphatically
of the oppressiveness of the taxes,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> suggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>that at any time the barons refused to give the
king what he asked for. The probability is
that Henry I sought baronial assent merely
as a matter of form, and that he did it out
of respect, more or less conscious, for the
theory that contributions of a feudatory toward
the support of the crown should be of
a nature voluntary. The perfunctory character
of the assent, together with the absence
of evidence looking to a refusal, points to
nothing so much as the firmness of the royal
grip upon the purses of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stephen,
1135-1154</div>

<p>During the major part of King Stephen’s
nineteen turbulent years, feudalism and anarchy
ran hand in hand. Such progress as
had been making toward parliamentary taxation
ceased. Stephen showed himself an adept
at misgovernment and succeeded in nothing
so well as in his own discomfiture.</p>

<p>Things went by contraries. Stephen allowed
the nobles to make themselves impregnable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the royal castles and then sought to
dislodge them by raising up a new and hostile
baronage. The nobles, needing money to
carry on war amongst themselves and against
the king, extorted it from the people. “Those
whom they suspected to have any goods they
took by night and by day, seizing both men and
women,” says the Saxon Chronicle,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> “and they
put them in prison for their gold and silver,
and tortured them with pains unspeakable, for
never were martyrs tormented as these were.”
And then, “They were continually levying
an exaction from the towns, which they called
Tenserie (a payment to the superior lord for
protection), and when the miserable inhabitants
had no more to give, then plundered
they and burnt all the towns, so that well
mightest thou walk a whole day’s journey nor
ever shouldest thou find a man seated in a
town, or its lands tilled.”</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon adds a detail which
fills out the picture of wretchedness. Speaking
of Stephen’s promise to abolish the Danegeld in
1135, shortly after his accession, the chronicler
says, “The king promised that the Danegeld,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>that is two shillings for a hide of land, which
his predecessors had received yearly, should
be given up forever. These ... he promised
in the presence of God; but he kept none of
them.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>By the treaty of Wallingford in 1153,
Stephen agreed that the crown should descend
at his death to Henry of Anjou,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> <span class="sidenote">Henry II,
1154-1189</span> the son
of the Empress Matilda, and great-grandson
of the Conqueror. The treaty provided, also,
for comprehensive reforms which Stephen, a
melancholy figure in contrast with the vigorous
Henry, tried to work out. Stephen died
at the end of a year’s attempt to put in operation
the new programme and Henry came to
the throne. Henry’s reign was marked by a
regular and peaceful administration of the
government which had its rise in the genius
of the king for organization. It witnessed
too the struggle with Thomas à Becket, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>conflict which has been pointed to as “the
first instance of any opposition to the king’s
will in the matter of taxation which is recorded
in our national history.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The story of it is full of dramatic interest.
At the Council of Woodstock in 1163, “the
question was moved,” <span class="sidenote">Controversy
with
Becket
over the
Sheriff’s
Aid</span>
so goes the Latin
narrative, “concerning a certain custom.”
This custom, which amounted to two shillings
from each hide, had previously fallen to the
sheriffs, but this “the king,” so continues the
Latin account, “wished to enroll in the treasury
and add to his own revenues.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In response to this, Becket is recorded as
saying, “Not as revenue, my lord king, saving
your pleasure, will we give it: but if the sheriffs
and servants and ministers of the shires will
serve us worthily and defend our dependents,
we will not fail in giving them their aid.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>This was from the chancellor turned archbishop.
In his former estate Becket had not
shrunk from pressing money composition
for military service from prelates holding
land of the crown on the ground that they were
tenants-in-chief and therefore owed service
of arms to the king. But now he had changed
his masters and stood champion of the church.</p>

<p>To him Henry returned, “By the eyes of
God, it shall be given as revenue, and it shall
be entered in the king’s accounts; and you
have no right to contradict; no man wishes
to oppress your men against your will.”</p>

<p>“My lord king,” Becket declared, “by the
reverence of the eyes by which you have sworn,
it shall not be given from my land and from
the rights of the church not a penny.”</p>

<p>Apparently for the moment the archbishop
won his point, but from that time on, Becket
and the king stood apart. The continuation
of the struggle between them at Westminster
the following October; the Constitutions of
Clarendon, sweeping away much of the exclusive
authority which previously had characterized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the flight of
Becket into France; the coronation of the
young Henry by the Archbishop of York to
the prejudice of Becket, and the latter’s declaration
of illegality; these and the martyrdom
of the archbishop, are parts of another
story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The issue
in the
Woodstock
Controversy,
1163</div>

<p>Exactly what were the motives of Becket
in making his stand against the king at the
Council of Woodstock, are somewhat difficult
of determination. The interest of the king
was obvious; he wished to increase his revenue
by annexing the “auxilium vicecomitis” or
“Sheriff’s aid,” which had not gone into the
royal treasury at all but had served to swell
the private income of the sheriffs. Whether
Becket, “standing on the sure ground of
existing custom,”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> objects to change merely
because it was a change; or whether he had in
mind some lofty democratic principle, and
took his stand against the royal power in
favor of the lesser folk through some flush of
democratic fervor, is not only impossible of
being decided, but the decision would not be
of strict relevance to the subject. The two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>points to observe, and they are perfectly
evident, are that Becket’s stand against the
king did not concern a new levy of taxes, but
an imposition already customary; and that
the king asserted Becket’s incompetency to
interfere. Becket had presumed to take a
hand in a matter connected with taxation;
the king had denied him that right, though
the archbishop was the chief member of his
National Council. Therein lay a great issue.</p>

<p>A number of other incidents of the reign
of Henry II, though they lack the color of
a controversy between archbishop and monarch,
are nevertheless worthy of consideration.
<span class="sidenote">Scutage</span> The imposition in 1159 of the Great Scutage,
despite the fact that it came as a feudal
charge rather than as a form of regular taxation,
assumes great importance in view of
the part that scutage played in the evolution
of the taxing power.</p>

<p>Scutage is generally considered as one of
the forms of “commutation for personal
service,” and commutation was undoubtedly
the underlying idea of the imposition.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
payment was made for every knight owing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>military service. Each knight holding of the
king was expected to serve in the field for
forty days. Eight pence a day in the reign
of Henry II was the usual wages of a knight,
and for forty days the wages would amount
to two marks, which was the sum most
commonly paid in lieu of personal service.
It was in its earlier phase distinctly a feudal
charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early instances
of
Scutage</div>

<p>Payment of scutage, like most of the other
forms of feudal and general taxation, struck
its roots far into the past. Bishop Stubbs
fixes 1156 as the year in which the term scutage
was first employed.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Others find counterparts
in various payments to the sovereign
in the time before and shortly after the Conquest.
In the reign of Henry I the practice
of allowing ecclesiastics to compound at a
fixed rate for the knight-service due from
their estates was generally followed. The
privilege was sometimes extended to mesne
tenants.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> One writer<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> points to Ranulf Flambard’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>device in 1093, when he took from the
men of the fyrd the money which had been
given them for the purchase of supplies while
on the march. Others<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> suggest the Anglo-Saxon
<i>fyrdwite</i>, the payment made by the
king’s men when they were absent from the
royal train in war time as the analogy and
precedent for scutage. It seems more likely
that the king and his vassals adopted a money
payment in lieu of service because it was
convenient for both of them.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The king
thereby got the means for the enlistment of
a body of mercenaries, subject to his absolute
will, and the barons were relieved, if so they
pleased, of the burden of military service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great
Scutage,
1159</div>

<p>The levy commonly spoken of as the Great
Scutage was made in 1159. Henry II was
considering an expedition into France against
the Count of Toulouse. He had a claim to
the latter’s lands through the inheritance of
his wife, the Duchess of Aquitaine. The
English baronage, by the terms of their feudal
tenure, were bound to follow their lord into
the field. Nevertheless a distaste had arisen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>of late among them for service abroad, and
it was natural enough, therefore, that they
should fall in with the scheme of Henry and
his adviser, Thomas à Becket, for a commutation
in money. Henry levied a charge of
two marks (£1, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) on the knight’s fee
of £20, annual value, from such of his vassals
as chose not to follow him into France.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The authority by which this payment was
demanded was apparently solely that of the
king. It is probable that the levy was unquestioned.
In view of the facts that this
was merely a change, and possibly no very
great change, in the method of meeting a
regular feudal obligation, and that many of
the barons were willing to avail themselves
of a means of escaping the burden of foreign
service, the want of a recorded protest is not
to be wondered at. The chronicler puts it
plainly and probably with accuracy when he
says that Henry “received” a scutage.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>was profitable for the king. The chronicler
puts the proceeds at “one hundred and twenty-four
pounds of silver.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theobald’s
complaint,
1156</div>

<p>Three years previously, however, an ecclesiastical
complaint was raised against a similar
imposition. In 1156 such prelates as held
their lands by military tenure were directed
to compound for soldierly service which their
character of churchmen precluded them from
rendering.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Some thirty-five bishops and
abbots paid the assessment, but Archbishop
Theobald raised vigorous protest.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He objected,
apparently, not out of principle, but
because he could not see that the exaction was
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> This probability, together with
the further considerations that the demand
was not a demand for a new tax but merely
that the prelates compound for an obligation
long recognized as lawful, and that there were
precedents for precisely this sort of commutation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>makes Theobald’s protest not of great
importance. He did not question, strictly
speaking, the right of the king to levy taxes at
all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early step
toward a
tax on
movables</div>

<p>The remainder of the reign of Henry II,
aside from the fact that it witnessed the temporary
passing of the Danegeld,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> derives its
chief importance by reason of the extension
of taxation to cover personal property. By
the Assize of Arms in 1181, “every free layman
who had in chattels or in revenue to the
value of sixteen marks” was to “have a coat
of mail and a helmet and a shield and a lance;”
and “every free layman who had in chattels
or revenue ten marks should have a hauberk
and a head-piece of iron and a lance.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Here was a step toward laying movables and
personal property open to taxation. Seven
years later, when Saladin had cut his way into
Jerusalem, personal property was forced to
contribute toward the Crusade. <span class="sidenote">The
Saladin
Tithe, 1188</span> This tax, the
so-called “Saladin tithe,” was laid at the Council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>of Geddington on the 11th February, 1188.
Present at it were archbishops and bishops
and the greater and lesser barons,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but it is
not stated whether or not they gave a formal
consent to the levy. “This year,” so goes the
Ordinance, “each one shall give in alms a
tenth part of his revenues and movables,
except the arms and horses and clothing of
the knights; likewise excepting the horses
and books and clothing and vestments and
articles required in divine service of whatever
sort of the clerks, and the precious stones both
of clerks and laymen.” This is the earliest
recorded instance of a general tax upon
movables. For the assessment and collection
of the Saladin tithe, Henry adopted a scheme
favorite with him, which had been utilized
in England for national purposes at least
since the time of the Domesday Survey.<span class="sidenote">Assessment
by
Juries of
Inquest</span> It
was ordained that the assessment be done
by juries of inquest; thus the taxpayers themselves
were instruments in the determination
of how much each should pay, even though the
determination of how much the gross payment
should be was as yet far beyond their power.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>Henry II closed his reign in 1189. His
taxation<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> had never been exceptionally heavy,
though it had been the occasion for protest
and had served as the pretext in 1174 for a
little warring with his barons. In the matter
of royal authority over taxation, the power of
the king to levy taxes was not much diminished.
The instances of opposition that have been
cited do not prove much more than that now
and then complaining voices were raised in
the Great Council; nowhere is it shown that
the objections had more than passing value,
much less that they were conclusive.</p>

<p>The year after the laying of the Saladin
tithe, Henry died. Of his four sons, two were
dead and two had taken up arms against him.
His first son, who he had hoped would succeed
him as Henry III, was dead, and so too was
Geoffrey, the father of the luckless Arthur;
Richard, his second son, was for the moment
the ally of Philip of France; and John, whom
the king had loved above the others, now as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>afterward seeking his own advantage, had recently
taken his place amongst the rebellious
barons who had made common cause with
the king of France. This blow, coming on
top of his unfavorable peace with Philip,
struck the old king to the heart, and cleared
the throne for Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard I,
1189-1199</div>

<p>Richard was not, in the fullest sense of
the word, an English king. His heart was on
the Continent; England he regarded as a
treasure-house, and he left the administration
of it to his justiciars. Along with the exaction
of feudal incidents and other and more
special forms of taxation, Richard worked
the machinery of the laws to its maximum
capacity for what money it would bring him.
He sold bishoprics and ministries, and released
malefactors from prison for a consideration;
sometimes, as in the case of Ranulf
Glanville, his father’s treasurer, he threw
men into prison on shadowy charges and
forced them to buy their release. But all was
under the guise of legality; Richard, unlike
John, and much like Henry VIII, knew how
to gain his end and yet adhere to the letter
of the law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard’s
ransom</div>

<p>On his way back from the Crusade near the
close of the year 1192, Richard fell into the
hands of his enemy, Leopold, Duke of Austria.
Leopold turned him over to his feudal superior,
the Emperor Henry VI, and he held
Richard for a ransom of £100,000. The
levy of the king’s ransom was one of the three
regular feudal aids<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> for which the subjects
were responsible. The magnitude of Richard’s
ransom, however, brings it out of strictly feudal
history into the domain of taxation. In the
letter which Richard wrote from his German
prison to his mother, the Queen Eleanor,
and to his justiciars, he said, “For becoming
reasons it is that we are prolonging our stay
with the Emperor, until his business and our
own shall be brought to an end, and until we
shall have paid him seventy thousand marks
of silver.” The amount of the ransom was
subsequently raised to one hundred thousand
marks, with an additional fifty thousand
exacted as the price of not assisting the Emperor
in his war to regain Apulia. Thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
England became liable for the payment of a
sum aggregating £100,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It involves
heavy and
novel
taxation</div>

<p>The effort to raise so great a sum revived
all the forms of taxation known to England in
earlier years, and laid the basis for certain
methods of acquiring money previously unknown.
The justiciars <i>took</i> “from every
knight’s fee twenty shillings,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and the fourth
part of all the incomes of the laity, and all
the chalices of the churches, besides the other
treasures of the church. Some of the bishops,
also, took from the clergy the fourth part of
their revenues, while others took a tenth for
the ransom of the king.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In addition to the
property there stated as having been levied
upon, the lands of tenants in socage yielded
two shillings on the hide or carucate,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> personal
property to the amount of a fourth of its
value, and the wool of the Cistercians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Gilbertines. Thus every person in the kingdom,
was laid under contribution. Later
kings found all of these means of raising
revenue exceedingly fruitful, and some of
them served as precedents for taxes which
played great parts in the struggle for the
control of the public purse.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king
is the
authority
for the
taxes</div>

<p>The authority by which the impositions
were laid was apparently solely that of the
king. Speaking of the letter which Richard
addressed to his mother and the justiciars,
urging upon them the necessity for raising
money for the ransom, the Chronicler says,
“Upon the authority of this letter the king’s
mother and the justiciars of England determined
that all the clergy as well as the laity
ought to give ... for the ransom of our lord
the king.” He speaks of the exactions having
been <i>taken</i>. The fact that there is no definite
record of deliberation or even of assent by
the National Council to the enormous demand
which the ransom of the king laid
upon England, and that no serious objection
was raised to the collection, ordered upon the
authority of queen and justices, is a comment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>both upon the weariness of the nation and its
respect for the ancient feudal aid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard’s
release and
subsequent
levies</div>

<p>When Richard was finally released from
durance in Austria, he returned to England.
Remembering the success which met his first
visit to the island at the time of his coronation,
he proceeded to set his machinery going
despite the financial decrepitude of the nation.
The account of his Great Council at
Nottingham, called near the last of March,
1194, illustrates not only his ingenious methods
of making extra-customary feudal exactions
but also the manner in which he levied his
non-feudal impositions. The Council, which
was not very fully attended, was composed of
the archbishops, bishops, and earls. On the
first day, he removed from office all the
sheriffs of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, and
proceeded to sell their places to Archbishop
Geoffrey of York, who paid 3000 marks<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> on
the spot with a promise of 100 marks by way
of annual increment. Having thus spent his
first day, on the second he contented himself
with issuing orders against his contumacious
brother John. But on the third day he demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>the third part of the service of the
knights, the wool of the Cistercians for which
he was willing to accept a composition, and a
carucage of two shillings.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This last, which
was the lineal descendant of the Danegeld,
a land tax on the carucate, he apparently did
not exact upon any other authority than his
own. The king “determined that there should
be granted to him out of every carucate of
land through out the whole of England, the
sum of two shillings.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> His action carries out
the theory that the voice of the king in his
Council was supreme in matters of taxation,
and that the promulgation of a tax levy was
rather accepted in the character of an edict
than as inviting discussion. The deduction,
however, that the individuals composing that
Council were barred from objecting to a tax
or even refusing to pay it, is not well founded;
the time had not yet come when the individual
felt himself bound by the tacit acquiescence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>of the Council. If he were strong enough to
withstand the royal displeasure, he could
refuse payment.</p>

<p>Richard levied a second carucage in 1198,
“from each carucate or hide of land throughout
all England five shillings.” Here, too,
he acted upon his own authority, and the
Chronicler does not refer to the summons of
a Council, or the participation of the magnates
in the laying of the tax. The assessment of
it followed the plan pursued by Henry II, in
that the liability of the taxpayer was determined
by means of a jury of inquest. Against
the payment of the imposition the men of the
religious orders demurred, whereupon an edict
of outlawry came immediately from Richard.
Esteeming the payment of the tax the lighter
burden, the friars yielded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugh of

National
Council,
1198</div>

<p>The same year, 1198, furnishes us with
what is by far the most noteworthy and interesting
incident of the reign of King Richard,
an event which is taken to be “a landmark
of constitutional history.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Through his
efficient justiciar, Archbishop Hubert Walter,
the king laid before his Council at Oxford a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>plan whereby he “required that the people of
the kingdom of England should find for him
three hundred knights to remain in his service
one year, or else give him so much money as
to enable him therewith to retain in his service
three hundred knights for one year, namely
three shillings per day, English money, as the
livery of each knight.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The way in which
Hubert Walter’s proposition was met throws
light upon the subservience of the National
Council. “While all the rest were ready to
comply with this,” the Chronicler proceeds,
“not daring to oppose the king’s wishes,
Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, a true worshipper of
God, who withheld himself from every evil
work, made answer that for his part he would
never in this one matter acquiesce in the
king’s desires.” Now, if it could be established
that the bishop raised the question as to
whether the king had a right to lay an imposition
upon the baronage and to require their
assent, then we would be justified in saying
that Hugh’s refusal went far toward anticipating
future history. But the evidence does
not uphold so generous an inference. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>the first place, it seems highly questionable
whether Hubert Walter really offered the
alternative of a money payment,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> a conclusion
which reduces the debate to one on foreign
service. But Hugh even here did not raise
the general question. “I know,” he is quoted
as saying, “that the see of Lincoln is held
by military service to our lord the king, but
it has to be furnished in this land alone;
beyond the boundaries of England nothing
of the kind is due from it.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Hugh, therefore,
refused to comply with the royal request on
purely feudal grounds. Basing his objection
on ecclesiastical privilege, he registered his
refusal for the see of Lincoln alone; he did
not take his stand in behalf of the barons or
even of the whole body of churchmen. The
issue as to their relative powers to tax was
not raised between king and Council, and the
withdrawal of Hubert Walter’s demand did
not constitute one of the first victories over
arbitrary taxation. The withdrawal itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>seems to have had its disagreeable consequences.
Herbert, Bishop of Salisbury, who
stood shoulder to shoulder with Hugh of
Lincoln in his opposition, had to pay a heavy
fine for his part in the contest, and the Abbot
of St. Edmund’s was obliged to win back
royal favor with a gift of a hundred pounds
which he made in addition to the pay of four
knights for forty days.</p>

<p>Richard’s reign covered only a decade, six
months of which he spent in England.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Notwithstanding
his long absence, during which
the National Council began in some small
degree to feel itself able to get along without
the royal presence, the authority of the king
as the supreme initiator of taxation remained
unquestioned. In the assessing of taxes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>however, the taxpayers had more participation.
The justiciars of Richard continued
Henry II’s practice of assessment through a
representative jury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John,
1199-1216</div>

<p>John, the youngest son of Henry II, the
thinnest figure that ever sat upon the English
throne, succeeded to the crown some six
weeks after the tragic passing of Richard.
Richard was the creation of his own times,
the incarnation of the mediæval spirit, and
where it fell short he fell short. To attribute
the meanness of his brother to any conditions
of environment would be to perpetrate
a slander upon the times. Yet, notwithstanding
the vileness of the king, there eventuated
from his reign the first of the three books
in what Lord Chatham denominated “the
Bible of the English Constitution.” The progress
toward the finished writing of Magna
Carta, especially in so far as the events concern
laying of taxes, is the next step in this
history.</p>

<p>An interregnum of six weeks elapsed between
the death of Richard and the coming
to England of John. Then Archbishop Hubert
Walter set the crown upon his head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
declared him elected to the kingship. John’s
stay in England was necessarily brief, because
Philip II of France was already in a
fair way to win his possessions on the far
side of the Channel. For his expedition into
Normandy John exacted a scutage of two
marks on the knight’s fee; the rate was unusually
high, almost without precedent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John’s
heavy
taxation</div>

<p>Being unable to make head against Philip,
John concluded a truce for which he had to
pay 30,000 marks. The Jews had to pay a
good deal of it and in addition John took a
carucage of three shillings on the carucate,
which, like the charge of scutage, was an
exceedingly high rate. John laid this imposition,
apparently, solely upon his own authority;
Roger Hoveden says that he “took” the carucage
and makes no mention of a Council.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
He demanded the aid, and the justices issued
the edicts. In 1201 John contributed, at
the instance of a papal delegate, a fortieth
of his revenues for the Crusade; from his
barons he urged a similar offering, not “as a
matter of right or of custom or of compulsion.”
Freeholders and tenants by knight’s service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>paid at a similar rate; just what liberty they had
in refusal is shown in the direction of Geoffrey
Fitz-Peter, the justiciar, at the end of his address
to the sheriffs: “And if any persons shall
refuse to give their consent to the said collection,
their names are to be entered in the
register, and made known to us at London.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
In the same year he exacted a scutage at the
high rate of two marks on the knight’s fee.</p>

<p>The importance of the part which scutage
played in the tragedy of John can hardly be
overestimated; it was the great moving cause
which brought about the crisis of 1215 and
Magna Carta. <span class="sidenote">Scutage, a
cause
leading to
the
Charter</span> Not only did John raise scutage
to an amount which had not been equalled
since the Scutage of Toulouse in 1159, but he
levied it as though it were a regular and almost
annual obligation. Previously understood as a
commutation arranged at the pleasure of the
king for knight’s service not rendered, as an
extraordinary impost reserved for extraordinary
occasions, John changed its character
and used it as a means of supplying his heavy
financial needs, irrespective of customary right
or of shrewd policy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>John began with a demand of two marks on
the knight’s fee.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The barons had accustomed
themselves, during the reigns of Henry and
Richard, to expect at the outside a demand of
twenty shillings; sometimes indeed the imposition
had fallen to a single mark or even as
low as ten shillings. His second scutage came
in the third year of his reign, two marks on
the fee. Then for four successive years John
kept his barons on edge with annual scutages
of two marks each. In 1205-06, apparently
fearing a storm, he reduced his imposition to
twenty shillings, and then waited for three
years before laying another. The three years
of relief, however, were not as innocent as
they seem; it was in 1207 that John broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>with the Pope, and the freedom to plunder
ecclesiastics which this quarrel gave him,
made unnecessary for the moment any further
demands upon the baronage. But this source
of revenue shortly proved insufficient, and
John turned again toward scutage. In the
two financial years from 1209 to 1211, he
laid three scutages which aggregated some
seventy-three shillings on the knight’s fee.
Then for the space of two years John
paused.</p>

<p>But it was only a pause. On June 1, 1212,
he caused to be taken the Inquest of Service,
<span class="sidenote">Inquest of
Service,
1212</span> by which he sought to bind the cord more
tightly upon his demesne tenants by ascertaining
in the now familiar manner of the local
jury, how great was the return which he
might expect from the lands of each crown
vassal. It is easy to see in this Inquest, recalling
in its nature Domesday Survey and the Inquest
of 1166, the intended basis for another
imposition of scutage.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It came in 1213-14,
when John made the wholly unprecedented
levy of three marks on the knight’s fee. Apparently
he was doing all he could to hurry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>the crisis which should lead him to Runnymede.</p>

<p>There were two features of John’s use of
scutage aside from the magnitude and frequency
of his levies <span class="sidenote">Attendant
abuses of John’s levies of Scutage</span> which made them particularly
onerous. The first had to do with the
fines which he exacted from such of the
baronage as were delinquent in paying the
imposts of Richard, some of which had been
in arrears since 1190. Miss Norgate notes
an instance which illustrates John’s habit,
and throws light upon his character. Two
men of Devon in 1201 were charged with
fines by reason of their absence from the
train of Richard in 1193, and the cause of
their failure was this, that “they had been with
Count John.” At the moment John was in
rebellion against Richard, but now that he
was become king in Richard’s place, he exacted
fines for service the nonperformance of
which he himself had been the cause of.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The
collection of fines owing to Richard bore with
special heaviness upon the northern baronage
and these, it will be remembered, were the
leaders in the assault upon John in 1215.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>The other great abuse which John introduced
into the levying of scutage was his
subversion of the theory that the payment of
it by the vassal wholly acquitted him of his
obligation to the king for that occasion. John
endeavored in a number of instances to make
him liable for personal service in addition,
and for fines in case he failed to be present
in his train. In 1199 John exacted fines from
those who did not accompany him to Normandy;
in 1201 he accepted money-payment
as a substitute for service; in 1205 he fined the
tenants-in-chivalry after he dismissed them
from service in the host. In these years scutages
were laid as well.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Thus did John make over scutage; it had
become a heavy impost upon the lands of
demesne tenants, an almost annual charge,
and a tax foreign to its original character as
a commutation for personal service. A rebellion
culminating in the exaction from John
of a written contract between him and the
baronage, detailing their mutual relations was
the natural consequence.</p>

<p>But the knights were by no means the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>body of Englishmen whom John alienated
by his frequent levy of taxes. <span class="sidenote">Antagonism
of the clergy</span> The clergy,
already irritated by John’s quarrel with the
Pope and his seizures of ecclesiastical property,
were ready to combat the king in any further
attempt to tax them. At a Great Council at
London on the 8th January, 1207, the king
asked “the bishops and abbots to permit the
parsons and the beneficed clergy to give to the
king a fixed sum from their revenues.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The
prelates did not consent, and John brought
the matter up again at a second Great Council
which he convened at Oxford on the 9th
February. There were present an “infinite
multitude of prelates of the church and magnates
of the realm,” and John again addressed
the ecclesiastics. The bishops “unanimously
answered that the English church could in
no wise sustain what was unheard of in all
the ages before.” The king, “taking wise
council,” withdrew his demand, but he did
not abandon his project.<span class="sidenote">General
demand

 “Afterward he
ordained generally throughout the kingdom
that every man ... give a thirteenth part

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>demand applied to all men, no matter from
whom they held their lands.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Against the imposition,
the earlier analogues of which were
the Saladin Tithe and Richard’s ransom, “all
murmured, but none dared to contradict”
the king, except Geoffrey of York; he did not
consent, but openly refused, and then had
to fly from England to escape John’s anger.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The writ for the assessment of the thirteenth
has it that the tax was provided “by the
common advice and assent of our Council
at Oxford.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> How whole-souled was the
assent is revealed by the Chronicler; “none
dared to contradict.”</p>

<p>The time was at hand when men would not
longer endure the extortionate exercise of an
unchallenged royal right. <span class="sidenote">Normandy
is lost</span> There were a
number of conditions and circumstances aside
from the burdensome taxes which were pointing
toward Runnymede and Magna Carta.
By 1204 John had come to the end of his day
in France. Normandy was lost. The effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>upon England was marked; the Norman
baronage was obliged to choose between England
and the Continent. Hereafter tyranny
and good-rule of the English kings were
alike felt solely at home, and the barons
cast their eyes not across the Channel, but
upon their lands in England. The English
were for England and the nation was born,
the first conscious act of which was to be the
enactment of Magna Carta.</p>

<p>During the seven years from 1206-1213
John had his disgraceful quarrel with the pope,
a quarrel which ended in the enfeoffment of
England with Innocent as feudal overlord.
The matter is foreign to the subject in hand,
save as the struggle, especially in the early
development of it, gave John a pretext for
confiscating the ecclesiastical holdings and
thereby relieving the barons of a scutage for
the space of about four years.</p>

<p>John, conceiving that peace with the Pope
meant full mastery of affairs, was seized with
an ambition to reconquer Normandy. To this
end he tried to induce the barons to follow
him into Poictou. They refused, first on the
ground that John was not yet fully absolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
from his excommunication; and then, after
this objection was removed by Stephen Langton
on the 20th July, 1213, they raised the old
plea that they were not bound by their tenure
to follow the king abroad. John determined
to enforce their attendance upon him by show
of arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council at
St. Albans,
4th August,
1213</div>

<p>Before he started to the north, where the
seditious movement had its center, an assembly
was held at St. Albans on the 4th
August by Archbishop Langton, and the justiciar
Geoffrey Fitz-Peter. Its purpose was
to assess the amount due to the ecclesiastics
in consequence of the damage sustained by
church property during the quarrel with the
Pope. But its great importance lay in the
body of men who made it up. It is in so far
as we have record, the first occasion that representatives
of the lesser folk were summoned
to a National Council.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Beside the bishops
and barons who attended, there were present
the reeve and four men from each township on
the royal demesne. The Council advanced
somewhat beyond the simple purpose for which
it was summoned; the justiciar issued an edict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>against unjust exactions, to be observed as the
sheriffs valued their lives and limbs, and commanded
the observance of the good laws of
Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-noble
representatives
called
to Oxford,
1213</div>

<p>Later in the year to Oxford, the non-noble
representatives were again called, and at
the initiation of John himself. John hoped
to win to himself by this act of respect the
support of the smaller landowners against
the threatening barons. The sheriffs were to
send up, beside the knights holding from the
king, four discreet men from each county “to
talk with us,” as the writ had it, “concerning
the business of our realm.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This, provided
subsequent events had kept pace with it, was
an immensely long step forward; indeed the
provisions of Magna Carta themselves do not
advance to the point thus falteringly and unworthily
reached by John. It provided a
precedent for the representation of the third
estate in the councils of the nation; and
though it is not known whether or not any
action was taken relative to the levying of
taxes, or even whether the council was held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>at all, nevertheless the fact that representation
for the moment was provided for, marks
the step in the light of the present, as of great,
almost of profound, importance in the consideration
of parliamentary taxation.</p>

<p>It would be wandering far afield to trace
the final struggles of John with his infuriated
barons. It is sufficient to note that it was
an unauthoritative demand of taxation which
pulled the structure of John’s misgovernment
crashing down upon his head.<span class="sidenote">Events
leading to
Runnymede</span> On the 26th
May, 1214, John issued writs for the collection
of a scutage at the quite unprecedented rate
of three marks on the knight’s fee, for which
there was not a shadow of consent. The
northern barons, the same who had refused
personal service, now refused likewise to pay
scutage. In the face of precedent to the contrary,
they denied their liability to follow
him, not merely to Poictou but to any district
beyond the Channel, or to pay him composition
for not doing so.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> At his interview
with the contumacious barons in November at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Bury St. Edmunds, he reiterated his demand,
but they remained steadfast in their refusal.</p>

<p>From that time until King and Barons met
on the meadow near the Thames called Runnymede,
John’s sky was darkening. He did
his best to avoid the tempest, but with no success.
He attempted to break the union of his
enemies by giving the church and the people of
London special charters; it was the church,
headed by Stephen Langton, which stood
shoulder to shoulder with the barons in unending
hostility to John, and it was the citizens
of London whose adherence to the baronial
cause determined the final contest against
the king. John bought the services of mercenaries
to fight his battles for him, but when he
became penniless, they fell away. With
every expedient he could summon in his
extremity, he tried to avoid the breaking of
the storm. But the whole nation was against
him. The men of the North, who had been
steadfast from the beginning in their opposition
to John, were joined by barons of similar
mettle throughout the rest of England. The
citizens of London when they joined the ranks
of John’s enemies were followed by the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
partisans of the king, save only those few
who were attached by interest or necessity.
He signed the Charter the 15th June, 1215,
in the full hope that with the passing of the
tempest he might forget his promises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magna
Carta,
15th June,
1215</div>

<p>The Great Charter, in form granted by
John as a voluntary gift to the nation, was in
reality a treaty concluded between him and
his barons. That its provisions relative to
taxation are important has already been
hinted at; as a matter of history, the recurrence
of references to these particular sections
of the Charter proves the esteem in which
Englishmen of later generations regarded
this early book of their Bible of Liberties.
Whether this veneration, displayed by the
framers of subsequent and perhaps equally
important instruments, was based upon the
intrinsic value of the Charter or upon nothing
firmer than sentiment, is somewhat of a
mooted question.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The fact that it was held
in such esteem is for us the important and
sufficient reason for considering it in detail.
It is essential to understand upon what the
later champions of parliamentary taxation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>based their arguments, even though those arguments
presumed interpretations of Magna

have been far from admitting.</p>

light on the substance for these assertions.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The impositions which are specified in the
chapter are “scutage” and “aid.” The arbitrary
levy of scutage upon the lands of his
tenants was the chief moving cause which
brought John to Runnymede, and this chapter
undertook the correction of the abuse of
abuses. The aids mentioned are to be distinguished
from the incidents of feudal tenure,
reliefs, marriages, primer seisins, and similar
payments which are dealt with elsewhere in
the Charter and belong to the peculiar history
of feudalism. The twelfth chapter provides
that the three ordinary aids&mdash;for ransoming
the king, for knighting his eldest son, and
for the marriage of his eldest daughter&mdash;should
be reasonable in amount. These
might be exacted by the king as a matter of
course, without the common council of the
realm. The extraordinary aids, which the
Charter places in the same category with
scutages, include all other arbitrary feudal
exactions levied to meet some particular
emergency and in an unusual manner. The
Charter places both these extraordinary aids
and the obnoxious scutages beyond the pale
of royal imposition; hereafter they are leviable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
only “by common counsel” of the kingdom.
That they were to be laid by the body known
as the Common Council is indicated by the
provisions of Chapter Fourteen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provision
regarding
London</div>

<p>The people of London rightfully expected
to benefit by the granting of the Charter.
According to the last clause of the Twelfth
Chapter, it was to “be done concerning the
aids of the city of London” in the “same way.”
The provision is indefinite; whether the “aids”
were also to include in their category the more
arbitrary and therefore more obnoxious tallage<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
is unknown. The aids were for the most
part free-will offerings of the city itself, whereas
the tallages were exacted by the king upon
his own arbitrary authority as one having the
power of a demesne lord over London. And
whether or not the phrase “in the same way”
means that aids shall be levied by the common
counsel of the realm, or merely that they shall
be of “reasonable” amount, is difficult of determination.
If indeed the former idea was in
the minds of the framers of the Charter, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>they came to the section providing for the
composition of the Common Council, they
made no provision for the attendance of any
member of the corporation of London, or even
for securing their consent. At all events, the
king continued to tallage London at not infrequent
intervals and almost without question
until 1340, when Parliament took the privilege
away from Edward III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chapter 14</div>

<p>Before we advance to a consideration of the
true importance of the Twelfth Chapter, in
order to have a complete understanding of its
position in the line of progress toward parliamentary
taxation, we are obliged to look at
the method by which the common counsel
of the kingdom was to be taken. Chapter
Fourteen<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> lays down the rule according to
which the assembly was to be called that
should hold this power of assenting to scutages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>and aids. The method of summons
was simple; it involved the issuance of writs,
individually to the archbishops, bishops, abbots,
earls, and the greater barons, and
collectively to the lesser barons through the
agency of the royal sheriffs and bailiffs. The
writs gave at least forty days’ notice as to
the place and time of meeting, and specified
the business which furnished the occasion for
the Council. As for its composition, the answer
is very simple; it was a gathering of
tenants-in-chief of the king, of crown vassals.
The line between the greater and the lesser
barons was ill-defined. Roughly, however,
it divided the baronage into classes, one of
which included the baron whose holdings
embraced the major part of a county, and the
other the tenant of the king whose dwelling
was a cottage set in his dozen acres. It is
probable that the lesser barons played no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
considerable part in the assembly, and that
their attendance or non-attendance was of
little consequence. The light of the lesser
folk was as yet hid under the bushel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
advance
toward
Parliamentary
taxation</div>

<p>It is a conclusion easily drawn from the
text of the two chapters that this was a body
of feudatories called together for the purpose
of making feudal payments. The members of
the Commune Concilium were the vassals of
the crown and, save in rare instances, none
other; the taxation to which they were to give
their consent according to the terms of the
Charter, included no carucage or other general
tax, but only the scutages and aids which
feudal tenants of the king by military service
were expected to pay him as overlord. Furthermore,
the idea of representation in the
strictly technical sense into which present usage
has frozen the word, was quite wanting. It is
true that a consent by the barons gathered in
the Council to an imposition levied in accordance
with the notice stated in the summons,
was binding upon the barons who did not
attend, but this was on the principle that
absence gave consent, not that the consent
of the majority was binding upon a dissentient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
minority. The instance is quoted of
the Bishop of Winchester who in Henry III’s
time was relieved of his assessment because
he had opposed the levy in the Council.
John had introduced definite representation
in his summons to the Oxford Council in
1213, by directing the sheriffs to send up
“four discreet knights” from their counties
to treat with him “concerning the business
of his realm.” In respect of this, looking at
it in the light of later progress, the Great
Charter is positively retrogressive.</p>

<p>The conclusion is thus forced upon us that
save in the two cases of scutages and extraordinary
aids, with possibly the addition of a
third in the shape of tallaging the city of
London, supreme authority over general taxation
remained in the hands of the king.
The Charter provides solely for the financial
incidents of the feudal relation, and that in
the somewhat narrower aspect of tenure by
chivalry. The only true taxes, carucage and
John’s levy on movables known as the thirteenth,
were not referred to. It is an anticipation
of later history to read into the provisions
of Magna Carta either a definite inauguration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of national consent to taxation or of the
representative principle.</p>

<p>But the wedge was driven in. Notwithstanding
the omission of both the Twelfth
and the Fourteenth Chapters in subsequent
renewals of the Charter, the king lived up to
the principles therein set down; and notwithstanding
the absence in Magna Carta of provision
for parliamentary taxation in fact, it
was there in embryo. The nation, headed by
the barons, had set itself to the correction of
abuses, and it succeeded in attaining its immediate
end. Greater purposes were to follow,
born perhaps of the inspiration in the
Charter, and with the purposes were to come
also the means of attaining them. The nation,
having once taken a sip of the cup of control
over taxation, would not be content until at
last it had drunk deep from the well itself.</p>

<p class="pch">THE CUSTOM OF PARLIAMENTARY GRANTS<br />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Magna Carta</span> brought to an end the period
of absolutism and prepared the way for the
control by Parliament of the taxing power.
The barons, standing for the moment as the
champions of the nation, had wrung from
John the first concession. It really was not
as great a concession, in so far as the power
to tax was concerned, as eager advocates of
popular rights have maintained. But it was
the protest by the most influential body in
the kingdom and in effect by the nation itself
against unrestrained use of power by a royal
tyrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reign
of
Henry III,
1216-1272</div>

<p>The long reign of Henry III, stormy and
contradictory to itself, accomplished one clear
step forward. From one cause or another
it became customary for the National Council,
which in this reign first attained to the title
of Parliament, to grant money to the king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Another step, of vast importance in the later
history of parliamentary taxation, but in
Henry’s time probably not of intimate connection
with it, was the summons of the lesser
tenants and subsequently of the townsmen
into the councils of Parliament. There is no
sure record that in Henry III’s reign a Parliament
so constituted voted taxes, yet it is apparent
that this differentiation in the national
legislative body was the preliminary of the
vesting of the taxing power in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>John died in the midst of his reverses the
19th October, 1216. The major part of his
vassals were in the field against him, and
worse than all, Louis, the heir to France, with
French soldiers at his back, was in England
at the bidding of the English baronage. Nine
days after John’s death, his son Henry, a
nine-year-old lad, was crowned King of England
with small ceremony. After a lapse of
two weeks, on the 11th November, a body of
barons gathered at Bristol. There were four
or five earls, including Pembroke, Chester,
and Derby; eleven bishops, Hubert de Burgh,
one or two other ministers, and some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
military leaders. Only one of the executors
of the Charter figured at the meeting and this
was William of Aumâle. For the most part
they were of the party least disaffected by
John; the rabid opponents of the old King
were in the body of supporters around Louis
of France. The Council proceeded to appoint
William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke <i>Rector
regis et regni</i>, being unwilling to elect a relative
of the young King to this responsible
position. <span class="sidenote">Reissue of
the Charter
with
omissions</span> The next day they reissued the
Charter by common consent in the King’s
name, with the important omission of Chapters
Twelve and Fourteen.</p>

<p>The reason for leaving out restrictions upon
the royal power so vital to the feudatories is
readily apparent. The Council was distinctly
royalist; as such, especially in view of the
fact that John, the great offender, was dead,
it did not favor restricting the royal power.
Further, the barons in effect were themselves
the king, and being so, there was no particular
object in limiting their own power
over themselves. That the Fourteenth Chapter
would be observed, whether it were specified
or not, dealing as it did with the summoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the Council, went as a matter of
course.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>One of the objects in the minds of the Council
in reissuing the Charter was to win adherents
from the standard of Louis. In this they
were partly successful; but it took the decisive
defeat delivered to the French prince at the
Fair of Lincoln in May of the following year,
coupled with the loss of his reinforcing fleet
in August, to bring about peace. A treaty
between Pembroke and Louis followed in
September, and secured to the belligerent
barons the liberties of the realm and the
restoration of their lands. General pacification
between the parties came the 6th November
following, with the second reissuance
of the Charter, <span class="sidenote">Second
reissue
of the
Charter</span> this time in the form which
later generations of kings should be called
upon to confirm.</p>

<p>There was introduced into this draft of
the Charter a change which materially affects
taxation. Though Chapters Twelve and Fourteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>of John’s issue are ignored, there is
in the Forty-Fourth Chapter a distinct reference
to the levying of scutage.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> “Scutage,”
it says “shall be taken as it was wont to be
taken in the time of King Henry our uncle.”
In other words the consent of the barons was
to be no longer a prerequisite to the levying
of a scutage. The only restriction placed by
written law upon the king was that he should
take scutages according to the custom of
Henry II,&mdash;that is, that they should not
exceed in amount <span class="sidenote">Its
omissions</span> twenty shillings on the
knight’s fee. The barons who remade the
Charter thus abandoned the semblance of
taxation by the baronage which was provided
for under the terms of John’s enactment. It
was only a shadow which they left behind,
but nevertheless it was the shadow from which
something substantial could emerge, the germ
from which a creature of immense vigor
might develop. The omission, it is not too
much to say, is an exceedingly apt vindication
of the contention that at the time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Charter of John was enacted, the framers of
the instrument intended to create no barriers
against the royal power of levying general
taxation; if they had had in mind so fundamental
a change, it is unlikely that in 1217,
even though the radical faction was still feeling
the sting of defeat, these provisions should
have been allowed to lapse.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> It is profoundly
indicative both of the modest ambition of the
barons in 1215 and the obscurity of their political
vision in 1217.</p>

<p>But the future was fairer than the conditions
presaged. As a matter of fact, the king
observed in the majority of instances the
conditions imposed by the Charter of John.
<span class="sidenote">Text of
1215 is
adhered
to in
practice</span> Scutages of even less amount than those
“taken in the time of King Henry” were
taken with the consent of the National Council,
the sessions of which “continued as from
time immemorial,” though the provisions
for its summons had been laid aside. That
the barons were intending to retain control
as under the Charter is indicated by the fact
that a scutage under the date 24th January,
1218, “was assessed by the common council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>of our realm.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Bishop Stubbs believes that
this scutage was granted by the identical
Council which reissued the Charter the previous
November.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Furthermore, there is a note
of a carucage under the date 9th January,
1218, which “was assessed by the council of
our realm,” a remark which suggests that not
only did this Council determine to grant
feudal payments of scutage, but assumed as
well the power of registering its assent to a
general land tax.</p>

<p>If full credence can be attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
record here given that a tax was <span class="sidenote">Carucage
“assessed”
by the
Council,
1218</span> “assessed”
by the Council, and if the act of assessment
can be taken as indicating, so to speak, full-fledged
consent on the part of the barons,
then we have in this record of the Close Rolls
one of the very earliest instances of general
taxation by and through the English National
Council. That no greater attention was given
to the event than the scant sentence in the
Rolls, is perhaps not to be wondered at,
considering the youth of the king and the
coherent Council.</p>

<p>With such a Council, bent apparently upon
putting in practice greater privileges than it
had given itself in theory, the boy Henry began
his long reign. The good Earl of Pembroke
died in 1219 and Henry was left to the
conflicting counsels of Hubert de Burgh and
Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester.
Growing restive under them at last, in 1223
he secured a declaration from the Pope that
he was of age, he being then sixteen, and
swore to observe the Charters. But neither
of his reissues of the Charter could be called,
strictly speaking, voluntary; and liberties extorted,
in the sinister words of the sycophant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
William Briwere, “ought not by right to be
observed.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The uneasiness arising out of
this uncertain state of the Charters, led to
one of the first instances of a grant of money
on condition that grievances be redressed, a
manner of grant which served the Commons
many a turn in their subsequent struggles with
royal prerogative.</p>

<p>In 1224 war was on with Philip II for the
possession of Poictou. The taxation which
had not been severe up to this time, was
insufficient for the prosecution of a war with
France.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The justiciar at the Christmas

a fifteenth of all movables.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The barons,
acting beyond the power which even the
Charter of John had given them, refused to
consent, unless Henry should “of his own
natural and good will” renew Magna Carta.
<span class="sidenote">Conditional
grant of a
fifteenth
of movables,
1224</span> He yielded, and reissued both the Charter
of Liberties and the Charter of the Forests
in practically the same form as the issue of
1217. That the reissue partook of the nature
of a contract between the barons and the
king is evinced in the concluding portion of
the Charter itself.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> There it is openly
stated that “the archbishops, bishops, abbots,
priors, earls, barons, knights, freeholders,
and all persons of the realm, give the
fifteenth part of all movables to the king,”
“for this concession and granting of liberties.”</p>

<p>Here is an unequivocal instance of a tax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>on movables, applying to every person in
the kingdom from the archbishops and great
nobles down, granted explicitly by the Council
in return for Henry’s specific promise to
adhere to the Charter. It was the most
natural thing in the world, that the barons
should demand a favor in return for granting
one. They had Henry in a box and his
acquiescence is none the less natural. Yet
the action is of great importance in view of
later developments. Time and time again
the situation was to be repeated, and out of
repetition was to come usage which would be
frozen into law. It is of vast interest, therefore,
to note the appearance so early of the
conditional grant.</p>

<p>The Council continued to exercise the right
not merely of making grants of money in
consideration of a redress of grievances, <span class="sidenote">Other
conditional
grants and
instances
of refusal</span> but
also of refusing to make a grant at all, whenever
such a stand suited their convenience.
In 1232 the Earl of Chester, being spokesman
for the barons, objected to a request for
money with which to carry on the French
war, on the plea that they had served in person;
the clergy sought postponement, raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the significant plea of an incomplete assembly
of prelates.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Again, five years later, Henry being in
dire distress for money because of unwise
expenditure and the lightness of recent taxation,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
summoned an extraordinary council
of barons and prelates “to arrange the royal
business” and matters concerning the whole
kingdom. William de Ralegh, a clerk of the
king, introduced the royal needs, saying that
“the king humbly demands assistance of
you in money.” Sensing beforehand an attitude
of antagonism, he made this remarkable
concession, that “the money which may be
raised by your good will shall be kept to be
expended for the necessary uses of the kingdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>at the discretion of any of you elected for
the purpose.” But the barons failed to perceive
the greatness of the opportunity which lay
open to them. <span class="sidenote">Offer of a
disbursing
commission,
1237,
rejected</span> Had they but availed themselves
of it, they would have gone far toward
the establishment of the power of the legislature
over the public purse, and might have
accomplished in a moment, had they been
able to maintain their control, what many
succeeding parliaments were to strive for in
vain. But apparently the baronage was not
gifted with political perception; they saw only
a demand for money and “began to murmur.”
They complained that the foreign advisers of
the king had been wasting the royal revenue
and that there was no great enterprise afoot
which required a full treasury. Then the
king proceeded to conciliate them with what
in comparison with the proposed concession of
the disbursing commission, was a mess of
pottage; he ordered the renewal of the sentence
of excommunication of all violators of
the Charter, promised to abide by it himself,
and received three additional Councillors
named by the Council.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Thereupon a grant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>of the thirtieth part of all the movable property
in the kingdom was made by the lords
“for themselves and their villans.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In this
phrase of the writ is evidence in favor of the
supposition that the lords of the Council
regarded themselves as authoritative spokesmen
for their vassals. The money was to
be collected in accordance with the prescription
of the Council; four knights and a clerk
(appointed apparently by the king), were to
receive the assessment of each township
from the reeve and four men, elected for the
purpose. Here was evidence of progress;
the step was not very long from the assessment
and collection of a tax to the granting of
it by the people themselves. The king profited
to the amount of some £22,600.</p>

<p>After a lapse of five years, Henry found
himself, as he supposed, on the brink of a war
with France; he therefore sent out orders for
a session of the Council. Apprehending that
the summons presaged a demand for money,
the baronage, “because they knew that the
king had so often harassed them in this way
on false pretences, ... they made oath together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>that at this council no one should on
any account consent to any extortion of money
to be attempted by the king.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> When the
Council met, therefore, Henry was greeted
with a refusal, on the grounds that he had
engaged in the war without asking their
advice, and that <span class="sidenote">Refusal of
a grant,
1242</span> “he had so often extorted
large sums of money from them, which was
expended with no advantage; they therefore
now opposed him to his face, and refused
once more to be despoiled of their money to
no purpose.” Harking back to the conditions
of the grant of 1237, and laboring, apparently,
under the misconception that the king had
promised that the money be spent under the
direction of a disbursing commission, they
complained because they did “not know and
have not heard that any of the aforesaid
money has been expended at the discretion
or by the advice of any one of the said four
nobles.”</p>

<p>Thus did they refuse. But Henry was
neither to be robbed of his hoped-for supply
nor yet induced to give further concessions.
He therefore turned to strategy. Summoning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>the barons and prelates to him one by one,
he “begged pecuniary aid from them, saying,
‘See what such an abbot has given to aid me,
and what another has given me.’” By such
means he managed to wring from the barons
individually what he had been unable to
induce them to give in the Council. With
the money thus obtained Henry set out on a
campaign doomed to ignominious failure.
Before he came back to England he used this
expedition as the pretext for a scutage of
twenty shillings on the fee.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Similar success did not meet Henry, when,
two years later, he attempted to raise funds
with which to prosecute a Scotch war. In
the fall<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> of 1244 Henry summoned his Council
to London; he laid before it the story of
his recent journey to Gascony and used the
debts which he had incurred as the pretext
for a grant.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> He addressed the baronage in
person in the expectation that they would not
refuse a face to face appeal; the nobles, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>withdrew to consult amongst themselves,
with the result that a committee of twelve, representing
the three bodies of <span class="sidenote">Great
Council in
1244 holds
out for
supervised
expenditure</span> prelates, earls,
and barons, was chosen to draw up an answer
to the king. Simon de Montfort, Earl of
Leicester, whose great opportunity was not yet
come, served as one of the four earls; and
Richard de Montfichet, one of the few executors
of Magna Carta who still survived, acted
amongst the delegation from the baronage.
The reply was consistent with the works of both.
The committee complained of the nonobservance
of the Charter, of the rash and fruitless
expenditure of money, and demanded the
appointment of a justiciar and a chancellor “by
whom the kingdom might be consolidated.”</p>

<p>The king, however, was unwilling to act
under compulsion; he refused the petition and
ordered the barons to reassemble three weeks
after the Purification of the Virgin in 1245.
Thereupon the nobles declared their willingness
to grant him money, provided that in the
meantime the king should choose proper counsellors
and institute reforms. The proviso
which was of greatest importance, however,
was this, “that whatever money was granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to him should be expended by the twelve ...
nobles for the king’s benefit.” These conditions
were greatly to Henry’s distaste; he set
himself to wring money from the prelates, but
with no success. Then the Council “broke
up, much to the king’s discontent.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A scheme
of control</div>

<p>The historian proceeds to give a scheme of
reform which may possibly be the result of the
deliberations of the magnates, presented by
them to Henry for his consent.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It provides
for the election by the Council of four of its
“most discreet” members to serve as counsellors
of the king. “By their inspection,” the
account states further, “and on their evidence
the king’s treasury shall be managed, and the
money granted to him by the community in
general shall be expended for the benefit of
the king and kingdom according as they shall
see to be most expedient and advantageous.”
The four counsellors were to have numerous
other powers and duties, many of which are
suggestive of the scheme subsequently put into
practice by Simon de Montfort.</p>

<p>Of itself this scheme of reform is relatively
unimportant. But taken with the demand of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>the magnates that twelve of their number supervise
the expenditure of such money as they
should grant to the king, it assumes some significance.
It points toward the growing tendency
on the part of the barons to assume control,
not only of the granting of taxes, but of the expenditure
of the money so raised as well. For
some centuries thereafter the question as to
whether that control should lie with the king or
subjects was to be a prime subject of contention.</p>

<p>It would be a fruitless and uninteresting
task to illustrate further the control over matters
of taxation exercised by the Council during
this part of the reign of Henry III. The
instances in which the royal requests were
refused, and the occasions when the king
attempted to evade the refusal by private solicitation
were not infrequent.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> A single citation
may be excused, however, because of the
element of sinister humor which pervades it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Henry asked the Council for money on the
9th February, 1248, and was greeted with a
demand for a justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer
to be appointed by the Council itself.
This appeared distasteful to Henry, who was
learning the trick of independence. After a
delay of some five months he refused compliance;
whereat he discovered that no grant
was forthcoming from the Council.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Thereupon
Henry announced to his good citizens of
London that he would pass the Christmastide
with them, in order that he might freely accept
of their New Year’s presents.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be too much, it seems, to say that
the numerous cases in which the Council
denied to the king the financial assistance
which he urged upon them, prove the full
control, in any modern sense, of this body
over taxation.<span class="sidenote">Representation
as it
existed in
Henry’s
National
Council</span> The relation of Council to
king was still personal; the barons granted
their support or refused it, as vassal to feudal
lord, by no means as representatives of the
nation to the government. The grants seem,
indeed, to have been binding upon the nation
at large, and consequently it might be argued
that the barons were really representatives
of the nation, capable of acting for it. But
the argument is based upon a confusion of
terms; representation in the modern sense
was not at that time in England invented or
thought of. A baron who by virtue of his
prominence or his power makes a promise
which is binding upon those of less prominence
or less power, is not a representative but a
small despot. Such a position the barons
held who composed the National Council
under Henry III; they acted for the nation,
but they were not in the modern sense representatives.
The inference is readily drawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
then, that a body thus constituted could not
exercise any more than a personal control
over taxation.</p>

<p>The time was at hand, however, when the
period of transition to the impersonal relation
should begin,&mdash;the relation which exists
between representatives of the nation and
the government as personified in the king, the
relation recognizable to-day between the layers
of taxes and the spenders of the proceeds of
taxation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Knights of
the shires
called to
the Council,
1254</div>

<p>In 1254, during Henry’s absence in Gascony,
the regents, Queen Eleanor and Earl
Richard Cornwall, took steps to amplify the
Council for the time being with the lesser
feudal tenants for the purpose of laying taxes.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
John, at his St. Albans Council in 1213, had
had recourse to a similar expedient, though
the principle involved was quite different. In
the earlier instance a representative reeve
and four men from each township and the
royal demesne were summoned in order to
assess the amount due in restitution to the
clergy. In the latter the royal writs directed
that from each of the counties two “lawful and
discreet knights” be sent up to Westminster,
“who together with the knights from the other
counties whom we have had summoned for
the same day, shall arrange what aid they are
willing to pay us in our need.” The knights
were to be chosen by the counties themselves,
probably in the county court, since there the
machinery of election already was in existence.
The election of knights by the body of
suitors who composed the courts of the counties
was by no means a new thing; for eighty
years there is evidence of the election of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
representatives for local purposes, and it would
be no startling innovation to extend this function
of the courts to the election of representatives
in a national council. In the present
instance, furthermore, there is in the writ an
implication, though the deduction is hazardous,
that the matter of the aid received previous
consideration in the county courts themselves.
“And you yourself carefully set forth to the
knights and others of the said counties,” so
continues the instructions to the sheriff, “our
need and how urgent is our business, and effectually
persuade them to pay us an aid sufficient
for the time being; so that the aforesaid
... knights at the aforesaid time shall
be able to give definite answer concerning the
said aid to the aforesaid council, for each of
the said counties.” The upshot of this Council
was disappointing to the crown; nothing resulted
except a renewal of complaints against
the royal administration. Simon de Montfort,
whose position as the defender of the rights of
Parliament, was as yet quite misapprehended,
took occasion to warn the Council against the
policy of the king.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>The events of the next fifteen years, vital
as they are to constitutional history, must be
briefly gone over. It is the period of the
Barons’ War and the Provisions of Oxford,
and finally of Simon de Montfort’s famous
Parliament of 1265. But the years did not
intimately affect taxation, save as they provided
more or less definitely for the body which
should ultimately have control over the granting
of taxes. Taxation was a prime cause of
the baronial irritation which led to the trouble
with the king, but the conflict was not a
moving cause in the final attainment by Parliament
of exclusive power over taxation. The
chain of events, however, in so far as they are
pertinent to the subject, must be traced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strife between
king
and Parliament</div>

<p>At the Hoketide Parliament<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> of 1255 the
usual demand was made for an elective ministry
and was refused;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> at the adjourned session of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>this Parliament the following October, an
aid to the king was denied on the distinct
ground that the members, all magnates, had
not been summoned according to the terms
of Magna Carta.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The struggle, vain and
threatening of future ill, went on through the
next year, until by 1257 the king found himself
plunged inextricably into debt, much of which
was owing to the Pope. The latter had undertaken
a war with Manfred with whom was
lined up the Hohenstaufen power, to seat on
the throne of Sicily Edmund Crouchback,
Henry’s second son.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Henry owed him 135,000
marks, and it is said that the Londoners,
the sheriffs, the clergy, and the Jews therefore
suffered.</p>

<p>The first Parliament of 1258 was held at
London on the 9th April and sat for about a
month. The purple robes in which Henry
garbed his foreign favorites shone richly
against the gray background of his asserted
poverty, and their brilliance was enough to
blind the eyes of the Parliament to his necessities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Wars were threatened on the northern
and western borders, and the Pope was brandishing
his sword of excommunication in case
Henry continued his dilatory policy toward
Apulia. Parliament refused his urgent plea
for a tallage of one-third of the movables of
the realm, reprehending the simplicity of the
king in making his bargain with the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
An outbreak was avoided by an adjournment
until the 11th June at Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions
of Oxford,
1258</div>

<p>On that day the barons and higher clergy
came together, bringing with them a heavy
burden of grievances. A scheme of reform
was drawn up in the famous Provisions of
Oxford. They projected the control of the
government by a number of representative
committees.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The only point upon which
the Provisions of Oxford touch the question
of taxation is in the section which arranges
for the appointment of a committee of twenty-four
“by the whole of Parliament on behalf
of the community” to treat of the aid demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>by the king for the prosecution of his war.
The list of grievances, furthermore, for which
the Provisions were to win redress, did not
bring up the matter of the royal power to
levy taxes in any degree whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
nearest approach to such an objection came
in the complaint against extortions under the
feudal law and in the reference to the manner
in which prises were exacted. In each instance
the remonstrance was not against the
principle but against the manner in which the
act was accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
Provisions</div>

<p>The Provisions of Oxford furnished no
advance in the general progress toward parliamentary
taxation. The only step was a step
backward. They provided for one committee
which should have the power of granting an
aid to the king, and delegated to another
most of the business of Parliament. These
were movements, not toward the ideal grasped
in the time of Edward I and realized in the
Bill of Rights, but of a character distinctly
retrogressive. The government was advantageous
to none save to those who participated
in it, and between the participants there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>no mediator in case the distribution of advantages
should be questioned. Theoretically the
king’s authority remained, though it was in
restraint; in fact it was given to an irresponsible
and self-interested body of barons subject
to the mutual jealousies which are always the
incidents of oligarchic rule.</p>

<p>The provisional government lasted for a
year and a half from its erection in June,
1258, without interruption; thereafter it continued
for four years with a number of breaks
until 1263, the year in which civil war began
between Earl Simon and the king.</p>

<p>In the middle of 1261 Henry produced bulls
which the Pope Alexander IV had granted
to him shortly before he died absolving him
from his oath to observe the Provisions, and
pronouncing excommunication upon all those
who should contravene the absolution.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The
act of Henry all but brought forward the impending
civil war. Simon de Montfort <span class="sidenote">King and
Earl Simon
call knights
of the shire
to national
assemblies</span> and
his colleagues, probably in the hope of winning
the popular mind to their cause, acting as
chiefs of the provisional government, addressed
summonses to the various sheriffs inviting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>three knights from each shire to attend
an assembly at St. Albans. Henry, fearing a
general movement against him, sent out
counter orders to the sheriffs, requiring them
to send knights not to St. Albans but to
Windsor, <i>nobiscum super præmissis colloquium
habituros</i>.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In all probability neither of the
assemblies met; at least there is no suggestion of
a session of either in the chronicles of the time.
They assume importance, however, as foreshadowing
the later Parliaments of Simon de
Montfort, and as indicative of his policy to utilize
the county organization in national matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil War,
1263</div>

<p>Two years later, in June, 1263, Simon de
Montfort began war. The following December
the differences between the parties
were laid before Louis IX of France for his
decision. He, not unsympathetic with the
plight of his royal brother, made an award
in favor of Henry, saving to the barons and
Earl Simon only their rights under the Charter.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
But Simon de Montfort was in a position
to protest against the verdict. He vindicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>his attitude at the battle of Lewes,
14th May, 1264, and Henry, his relatives,
and his principal adherents found themselves
prisoners in the hands of the barons. A compromise
was effected by the Mise of Lewes,
which, after a reconfirmation of the Provisions,
provided for the release of Henry and named
a new set of arbitrators.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> By the fourth article
of the compromise, Henry was to take the
advice of his counsellors in administering
justice and choosing ministers; he was to
observe the Charters and to live moderately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Knights of
the shire
in Parliament,
1264</div>

<p>But Earl Simon was not satisfied. He
garrisoned all the royal castles with soldiers
friendly to his cause, and on the 4th June
sent out writs to the counties in the king’s
name summoning to London the following
October, “four lawful and discreet knights,”
who were to be “elected for the purpose by
the assent of the county to act for the whole of
that county,” and were to “treat with us of
the above-stated business.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This Parliament
when it met proceeded to compose a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>new scheme of government, the chief feature
of which was a standing council, indirectly
elected by the barons, which should be the
moving force behind all royal acts,&mdash;that is,
the king was to act only in accordance with
the will of the council.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Simon de
Montfort’s
great
Parliament,
1265</div>

<p>Simon de Montfort on the 24th December
following issued writs in the king’s name bidding
the sheriffs to send up two knights from
the shires, and each of some twenty-one especially
designated cities and boroughs to send
up two citizens and burgesses to London.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
The Parliament was called for the 20th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
January, 1265. Beside the representatives
of the cities and boroughs, there was a very
full gathering of the clergy. The baronage,
who as a body looked upon Earl Simon’s
cause with small favor, were called upon to
send only twenty-three of their number, five
earls and eighteen barons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
instance of
burgher
representation
in
Parliament</div>

<p>It is upon this Parliament that the fame of
Simon de Montfort as the Creator of the
House of Commons is established. Unless
we admit as an instance of borough representation
the summons of the reeve and four men
from the demesne townships to the St. Albans
Council in 1213, we have here the first participation
of the burgher class, the Third Estate
of the Realm, in the Parliament of the nation.
It was to compose, along with the
recently admitted representatives of the shires,
the <span class="sidenote">The House
of Commons
is
foreshadowed</span> House of Commons, and in its hands the
destiny of the power to tax was to lie. That
Simon de Montfort summoned the citizens
and burgesses to the Parliament of 1265 is
attributable chiefly to the fact that they were
amongst the most ardent of his supporters.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
It is extremely doubtful that he acted in accordance
with any great scheme of constitutional
reform. He called the burghers because he
found their support useful, and therein lay
the greatest hope for the future; the time was
not far distant when a greater than Simon de
Montfort should discover that a Parliament
in which cities and boroughs and counties
were alike represented was the most convenient
means of supplying the royal treasury.</p>

<p>As for Simon de Montfort’s Parliament,
its importance to taxation lies wholly in its
significance in the elaboration of the representative
principle; there is no record that it did
aught with respect to taxation. Its business
was mostly confined to concluding arrangements
begun in the Mise of Lewes for the
government of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last years
of
Henry III</div>

<p>What was left of the reign of Henry III,
already stretched beyond its time, is all but
negligible. The position of Simon de Montfort
was too favorable to keep him clear of
jealous rivals. War speedily started up again
and in an early battle, that of Evesham, the
great earl was slain. Two years thereafter,
the royalist party managed to get the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hand and the war came to an end. Henry
was wise enough, or old enough, not to tempt
Providence; he continued his reign according
to the dictates of law and of good policy. By
the statute of Marlborough in 1267 were
granted most of the measures of reform which
had been demanded nine years previously in
the Mad Parliament of Oxford. With the
affairs of state running thus smoothly, Henry
moved tranquilly down the long slope of his
last years.</p>

<p>In October, 1269, there occurred an incident
which, if indeed the report be well founded,
sums up the attainments of his reign. Henry
brought together a great assembly in honor of
Saint Edward, an assembly of magnates lay
and clerical, and likewise numbering certain
representatives of the cities and boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
After the conclusion of the ceremony, Henry
convened the barons as a Parliament, and received
from it a grant of a twentieth of lay
movables. Whether or not the burgesses and
citizens participated in the offering to the king
is unknown. But if that be the truth, enveloped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>as it is in the mist, then we can see
the newly-made legislators actually participating
in the most important of legislative functions,
and we are assured that the work of
Simon de Montfort had indeed borne early
fruit.</p>

<p class="pch">LAW OF PARLIAMENTARY TAXATION<br />
1272-1297</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Henry</span> died the 16th November, 1272, with
his son, the great Edward, away on the
crusade. But there was no question as to
the succession; the most powerful of the
barons swore fealty to Edward <span class="sidenote">Edward I,
1272-1307</span> four days
after his father’s death, and when he returned
to England in the middle of 1274, he was
crowned King of England. In the interim,
the government was in the hands of the Archbishop
of York; the barons still resting after
their struggle with Henry III engaged in no
warfare other than their usual petty tumults.
The regular income of the crown sufficed for
the expenses of government.</p>

<p>The young king whose way to the throne
was thus paved for him, was one of the greatest,
if indeed he was not in truth the greatest,
figure which ever graced the English throne.
He is credited with being a lover of truth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
purity, honorable and contented with frugal
living; he was wary and at the same time determined;
an able councillor, ingenious in
working out the details of a plan, he was yet
most sure in accomplishment. Edward was
by instinct a legislator, and equally instinctive
was his love of arbitrary power. Yet his
wisdom kept him short of tyranny and showed
him that the fittest means of conserving his
own advantage was to allow Parliament reasonable
leeway and scrupulously to regard
the forms of its enactments. Edward was,
however, capable of utilizing the letter of the
law to the prejudice of its spirit. And therein
lay the chief defect in his generally ascribed
character of perfect monarch; he was not
above using the law to contravene the purposes
for which the law itself was designed.</p>

<p>Representation, which had “ripened in
the hand of Simon de Montfort,” Edward I
made the common fruit of the people. Edward
had the conception that the nation, if it
be strong enough to live in the face of dangers,
must act as the united backing of a strong king.
The relation, as he intended it, between king
and people is reciprocal; the strength of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
one is the strength of the other, and neither
must predominate. That was precisely the
relation which such a Parliament as that
called by Edward I in 1295, was capable of
bringing about; in it each of the three estates
had an essential share in the carrying on of
the government.</p>

<p>The early part of his reign is of importance
secondary to that of the decade ending with
1297. But an understanding of the supremely
important crisis which brought about the
Confirmation of the Charters is only to be
built upon a knowledge of the various events
which preceded it.</p>

<p>Before Edward returned from Palestine,
his regents summoned to a Parliament held
at Hilarytide 1273, not only prelates and barons,
but also four knights from each shire
and four citizens from each city.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The
purpose of the convention was the taking of
the oath of allegiance to the new king, and
the call was prompted doubtlessly by the
need of having the whole nation held loyal
to the absent and still uncrowned Edward.
Here was another instance of the growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>appreciation of the usefulness of the commons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s
first Parliament,
1275, and
the Statute
of
Westminster</div>

<p>There was no taxation in the reign of Edward
I, except as the clergy taxed the people
for the prosecution of the crusade, until
Edward called his first Parliament on the
22d April, 1275, at Westminster. The composition
of the assemblage is uncertain; the
implication of the Chronicler is that it was
a Parliament of magnates,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> but the introductory
clause of the Statute of Westminster
has it otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> “These be the Acts of
King Edward ...” it says, “by his council
and by the assent of archbishops, bishops,
abbots, priors, earls, barons and the community
of the realm being thither assembled.”
The Statute of Westminster, which was composed
of some fifty-one articles, included
a provision for regulating the feudal aids
which were required upon the knighting of
the lord’s son or on the event of the marriage
of his daughter. Twenty shillings on the
knight’s fee and twenty shillings from each
parcel of land held in socage yielding twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>pounds annually, were to be the maximum
rates thereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A custom
on wool</div>

<p>The great advantages gained by the nation
under the Statute of Westminster were not
won without a price. The same Parliament
made a grant of a custom on wool, woolfells,
and leather.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The parties to the grant were
essentially the same as those who registered
their assent in the preamble of the statute;
there was, however, this singular difference,
that it was done “at the instance and request
of the merchants.” The amount levied was
“a half-mark from each sack of wool, and a
half-mark from each three hundred woolfells,
which make a sack, and one mark from
each last of leather, exported from the realm
of England,” etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>The importance, both in a forward view
and in retrospect of this grant of a wool custom,
is very great. Parliament in granting
this custom assumed the power of assenting
to a tax which previously had been considered
within the peculiar province of the king. It
made a definite statement of what was to
be taken subsequently as the legal rate of
duty chargeable upon exports of wool. The
rate, which since the beginning of the century
had been agreed upon between royal officers
and merchants as their reasonable charge was
this half mark (6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) on each sack of wool
weighing 364 pounds, or on the estimated
equivalent of a sack, 300 woolfells, and a mark
upon each last (or load) of leather.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Exactions
above this rate were known as <i>mala tolta</i>, the
evil tolls, and the phrase had been shortened
to the single word maletolt. The forty-first
chapter of Magna Carta had promised to all
merchants freedom “from all evil tolls,” though
it continued the “ancient and right customs.”
Apparently, however, Henry III with respect
to this clause as in many another similar instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>did not deem himself bound to adhere
scrupulously to his promise. The Parliament
of Edward I at Westminster in 1275 settled the
matter; the “great and ancient custom” on
wool was legally determined, and thereafter
a larger exaction would be regarded as illegal.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s
Second
Parliament,
13th
October,
1275</div>

<p>Edward summoned a second Parliament for
the 13th October following in a manner which
gives ground for the presumption that the
presence of the knights of the shire in a parliament
designed primarily for the raising of
money, was already becoming a custom. The
point cannot be better illustrated than by a
translation of the writ itself.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> “Since we
have bidden the prelates and magnates of
our realm,” so it goes, “to be present at our
Parliament which we will hold ... at Westminster,
to treat with us both concerning
the condition of our realm and of certain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>our business which we will declare to them at
the same time, and as it is expedient that
two knights from the county above-mentioned
be present at the same Parliament from the
body of discreet and lawful knights of the
same county, by the reasons above-stated we
command you that you cause to be elected
in your full county-court (in pleno comitatu)
by the assent of the same county, the said
two knights and that you cause them to come
to us at Westminster in behalf of the community
of the said county on the said day, to treat
with us and with the above-mentioned prelates
and magnates about the above-stated
business. And omit none of it.”</p>

<p>[Sidenote Attendance
of Knights
of the Shire
“expedient”
for
uses of
taxation]</p>

<p>Thus we observe that it was “expedient”
for the lesser landholders to be present in a
Parliament which was called for the purpose
of securing the grant of a tax. The tone of
the writ is most matter-of-fact, as though the
knights of the shire were considered scarcely
less usual attendants at Edward’s parliaments
than the magnates themselves. That the
king “declared unto them certain of his
business” and that they proved amenable
is exhibited by the fact that this Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
granted a fifteenth of temporal movables.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The next event of importance witnessed
the extension of the function of levying taxes
to the citizens and burgesses. By the fall
of 1282 Edward found himself in financial
difficulties. Since the Parliaments of 1275
taxation had been very light. He had received
in 1279 a scutage of forty shillings on
the fee on account of the Welsh war,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and he
received assistance from the clergy in 1279
and the years following. Beside the income
resulting from these grants, he still had his
custom on wool, but it was far from sufficient
for his needs, and he had been obliged to
have recourse to the rigid enforcement of
statutes, rigorous application of writs, notably
that of <i>Quo Warranto</i>,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and in 1278 he had
adopted the expedient, in after time to be
exercised frequently, of compelling all who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>possessed £20 a year in lands to become
knights, and to pay the fee incidental to the
attainment of knighthood.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Provincial
assemblies
at Northampton
and York,
1283</div>

<p>The Welsh war came on again in 1282 and
added to the king’s embarrassment. He was
unwilling to call a Parliament and took the
less public but also less efficient means of
negotiating with individuals for money with
which to carry on the war. He sent royal
commissioners abroad through the country
who should plead the king’s necessity and
accept grants from sheriffs, bailiffs, and mayors
as representing their respective communities,
and also from individual citizens and countrymen
upon their own behalf.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> These private
offerings tided the king over his immediate
necessities. Late in the fall, however, he
found his position untenable and was forced
either to call a Parliament or to adopt some
effective substitute. Being at Rhuddlan, in
the center of hostile country, and having most
of his barons with him, he was obliged to
formulate a new plan for the attainment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>his end or else to adopt existing machinery
to his purposes. He sent out writs on the
24th November bidding the sheriffs send
representatives to two provincial assemblies
at Northampton or York, as the case might
be, for the 20th January following. The
members were to include all those who were
capable of bearing arms, and who held lands
to the annual value of £20, not already with
the army; four knights from each county
having full power for the community of the
county; two men from each city, borough,
and market town, having like power for the
community of the same, “to hear and to do
those things which we on our part will cause
to be shown to them.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The clergy also
were summoned; the bishops were to bring
their archdeacons, the heads of religious houses,
and the proctors of the cathedral clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They make
grants of
taxes</div>

<p>These irregular assemblies convened as
they were bidden, the clergy and laity meeting
separately. The knights and burgesses at
Northampton made a grant of a thirtieth on
condition that the barons do likewise;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>clergy refused to make any offering at all
because the parochial clergy were not represented.
At York, the knights and burgesses
made the grant of a thirtieth without condition;
the clergy made promises which they did not
keep. When the collection was made, allowances
were admitted for the sums which had
been contributed upon private negotiation.
Notwithstanding the irregular character of
these Councils in view of later developments,&mdash;irregular
in that the parochial clergy and
the baronage were not represented and that
the meeting was not in a single general assembly,&mdash;they
marked the “transition from
local to that of central assent to taxation.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
The king had discovered that it was easier
to attain his end through a Parliament than
by private solicitation,&mdash;that is, if he were
to wait for the assent of the people at all. It
was a step on the road; Edward had decided
in favor of summoning a Parliament as
against asking for money from individuals.
It was more profitable.</p>

<p>There is no further record of taxation until
1289, save that of a grant in 1288 from Nicholas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
IV, of an ecclesiastical tenth for six years
in reward of Edward’s vow to undertake a
crusade,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and a scutage in 1285 on account of
the Welsh campaign of three years before.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Edward’s expenses, on the other hand, were
heavy. The prosecution of his foreign interests
in Gascony, where he had been in person
for three years, was a heavy drain upon the exchequer.
<span class="sidenote">Parliaments
of
1289 and

John Kirkby, laid the royal needs before
the barons, who responded that they would not
pay “until they should see the king’s face in
his own land.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Kirkby began to tallage the
cities and boroughs and the other demesne
lands of the king, “imposing upon them an
intolerable sum of money.” It is probable
that this as well as other royal tallages applied
only to such of the cities and boroughs as
were included in the royal demesne. As a
matter of fact, most of the boroughs were
included in the demesnes of the king.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The following spring Edward married his
younger daughter to the Earl of Gloucester
and besought Parliament for an aid “pur
fille marier,” though technically this was to
be paid only in the case of the marriage of
the king’s eldest daughter. Parliament proved
well-disposed, however, and granted forty
shillings on the fee. The manner in which
the barons and bishops who composed this session
of Parliament made their offering is noteworthy,
in view of the fact that the tenants-in-chief
intimated that they could speak only
for themselves. They made their own grant
of an aid and extended it “as far as in
them lies,” to “the community of the whole
kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The barons made special note
of the fact that the offering was an advance
upon the two marks which had been granted
to King Henry, and stipulated that this be not
drawn into precedent. As a matter of fact,
the tax fell only on the tenants-in-chief (just
why can only be conjectured), and the collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>was not made until many years afterward.</p>

<p>A second Parliament was held in July.
To it Edward summoned two or three elected
knights from each shire.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The design behind
the calling of the Parliament was probably
the securing of a grant of a fifteenth of
temporal movables, since it develops that
such a tax was laid at that session, by clergy
and laity alike.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Edward made a further
demand of a tenth of spiritual revenue, which
the clergy granted him on the 2d October
following.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Apparently these offerings to the
king were in payment for his banishment of
the Jews, who were hated for their usurious
habits and for their religion; the laity sought
their expulsion for the former reason and the
clergy ostensibly for the latter, but the offence
to their pockets doubtless did much to arouse
their religious zeal against the Jews.</p>

<p>The interval between 1290 and 1294 does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>not furnish a wealth of material. The royal
poverty coexisted with a spirit of restlessness
on the borders and in France during the four
years, and little was accomplished toward
relieving either the one or the other. In
1291 the Pope had complicated Edward’s relations
with the English clergy by giving him
a tenth of spiritual revenue for six years,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
and the barons holding estates in Wales gave
a fifteenth in 1292. Edward also had recourse
to distraint of knighthood, which as in 1282
was symptomatic of a straitened treasury.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Edward in June, 1294, held at Westminster
a Parliament which was attended by the
magnates of England and John Baliol, King
of Scotland. The barons determined upon
war with France, and proceeded to provide
for the outlay necessitated by it, not by a
general grant, but with private contributions.
John Baliol gave the income from the estates
which he held in England for three years, and
the other magnates “promised aid according
to their abilities.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> But the supply was far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
from being sufficient;<span class="sidenote">Seizure of
wool, 1294</span> Edward was obliged
to adopt extraordinary means to meet his
obligations. Shortly before the Westminster
Council Edward had made a move which later
assumed large proportions in the parliamentary
eye. He seized all the wool in the country,
belonging both to clergy and laymen, and
released it the following July at a rate which
meant scarcely less than redemption, three
to five marks on the sack, and which was
greatly in excess of the rate specified in 1275.
Edward had a shadow of legal sanction for
his act, perhaps the consent of the wool merchants,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
perhaps an ordinance of his Council.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>In any event, he had the great defense of the
exigencies of war, a plea which he knew how
to make effective. Early in July he seized
coined money which had been deposited in
the cathedrals and religious houses for safekeeping,
and had it removed to his treasury
in London. “And he got much money which
he never after restored,” says the Chronicler.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Edward summoned for the 21st September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>of the same year a general convocation of the
clergy to London. Beside the usual body of
prelates, there were in attendance elected
representatives of the parochial and cathedral
clergy. Edward demanded half the spiritual
revenue, to the great distress of the ecclesiastics.
They demurred, and urged a postponement
which Edward granted them. Upon their
reassembling, the king reiterated his demand
upon pain of outlawry in case of nonfulfillment.
<span class="sidenote">Clergy

<div class="sidenote">Knights of

<p>On the 8th October, Edward addressed
writs to the sheriffs ordering the election of
two knights in each shire who were to come
to Westminster on the 12th of the following
month. They were to be of “full power for
themselves and the entire community of the
county aforesaid, to consult and consent for
themselves and that community, to those things
which the earls, barons, and chief men shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>have agreed upon and ordained.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The next
day Edward sent out supplementary writs summoning
two knights from each shire in addition
to those previously called. There was no representation
from the cities and boroughs. The
laity proved more tractable than the clergy
had been at their assembly in September, and
readily accomplished Edward’s purpose. It
is probable that their deliberations were not
delayed, for on the same day with the assembling
of the Parliament, was dated the appointment
of the commissioners of collection.
The laity of the baronage and the shires gave
a tenth of all movables.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> A sixth of movables

or perhaps by way of tallage.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The step to the events and attainments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>the next year was not long, but it was of surpassing
importance. The year 1295 is painted
in scarlet on the canvas of constitutional
progress in England. It witnessed the Model
Parliament in the composition of which a
principle was applied which must ever stand
as the basic theory of popular legislative institutions;
<span class="sidenote">Events
leading up
to the
Model
Parliament,
1295</span>
indeed, without it, there can be no
lawmaking by the nation at all, and when
the taxing power be included amongst the
lawmaking functions, unless strict adherence
be given to this principle, the taxpayer can
never be assured of a voice in the laying of
taxes. Edward I, furnishing the pattern,
summoned the Model Parliament on the
expressed theory that “what touches all, by
all should be approved.” Here was the first
authentic instance of a perfect and complete
representation of the three estates in a national
legislative body giving its assent to taxation.</p>

<p>The events immediately prior to the calling
of the Parliament are of interest. Trouble
was on with the Welsh, and a Scotch war
began before the other was over. The French
king had transgressed Edward’s Gascon possessions
and his sailors had landed at Dover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
putting a convent and some houses to the
torch. Edward’s arms seemed doomed to
universal failure; nowhere were his prospects
bright. By no means the least serious feature
of his position was an empty treasury. With
the hope of devising the means of changing
his fortune, he summoned to Westminster for
the 1st August a Parliament composed of the
barons and prelates of the realm. The session
took place on the 15th August. The bulk of
the debate was upon the proposal for papal
mediation between England and France, and
no attempt was made to raise money. But it
was doubtlessly decided to ask for a grant at
the meeting of Parliament intended for the
following autumn.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">“What
affects all,

approved”</div>

<p>On the four days from the 30th September
to the 3d October, Edward addressed writs to
the clergy, the barons, and the sheriffs, the
last of whom were to send up the representatives
of the counties and the boroughs. In
the writs to the clergy, by way of preamble
Edward said, “As a most just law, established

<div class="sidenote">The Model
Parliament,
27th
Nov., 1295</div>

<p>The Parliament, since known as the Model
Parliament, assembled the 27th November,
1295, in accordance with the summons of the
king. Each of the estates met by itself, and
each made its grant to the king independently
of the others.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The barons and the knights
of the shire gave Edward an eleventh of their
movables, the clergy a tenth, and the burgesses
and citizens a seventh.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Here was the
perfect form for the laying of taxes. In 1283
the provincial councils at Northampton and
at York had suggested the composition of
the Model Parliament, but the foreshadowed
form was far from perfect. In 1295 the question
was fully answered as to how the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>should assent to taxation, in case their assent
should be asked. The Model Parliament
furnished the perfect mechanism; the question
was still in the air, however, as to whether
this mechanism should be the sole instrument
by which the laying of taxation should be performed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Similar
composition
at Parliament
of
1296</div>

<p>Events, however, were tripping one another
up in their haste to bring forward a suitable
answer. The Parliament of 1296, which met
at Bury St. Edmund’s on the 3d November,
clinched a precedent which should have its
weight in making the reply. Its constitution
was precisely the same as in 1295; the barons
and knights gave a twelfth of their movables,
and the citizens and burghers an eighth.</p>

<p>The clergy, however, held off. According
to the understanding reached the previous
December when Edward accepted from them
a tenth in lieu of a larger grant, they were to
meet a demand with a further contribution of
like amount,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> unless peace be declared in the interval.
In consequence, Edward was scarcely
ready to accept the apology of Archbishop
Winchelsey; the archbishop declared that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>should the clergy acquiesce, the papal will expressed
in the recently published bull “Clericis
laicos”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> would be contravened, and that
<span class="sidenote">Edward
puts the
clergy in
outlawry</span> therefore no grant would be forthcoming.
He would give his final answer after meeting
the clergy of his province at St. Paul’s
early in January, 1297. When at last his
reply was presented, it was in tenor different
from that given in November; the Pope’s
will was clear and it must hold. Edward
moved swiftly. Remembering the satisfactory
effect of his threat of outlawry in 1294,
he immediately placed the clergy beyond
the royal protection.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Some of the clergy
won back the favor of the king by making
individual contributions to the royal treasury,
an evasion of the terms of the papal bull
which was quite acceptable to Edward. On
the 12th February, the king, weary of waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>for a favorable movement from Archbishop
Winchelsey, ordered the seizure of the lay fees
of the clergy in the see of Canterbury, whereat
the archbishop brought forward his weapon
of excommunication. Thus did Edward find
disposed against himself and the royal cause
the powerful body of English churchmen, at
a moment when their adherence would have
been of vast advantage.</p>

<p>The Scots had been put down during the
year 1296 and Baliol removed forever from
Scotch territory. The momentary peace on
the borders made Edward feverish to avenge
himself upon Philip of France, who was
making free with Gascony. The trouble
with the church had served to delay preparations
which might speedily have reached
completion upon the granting of money at
the November Parliament, and Edward was
in no temper to brook further interference.
He had formulated a plan of campaign
against the French which provided not only
for an expedition into Gascony in reinforcement
of the army already there, but for the
landing of a powerful force in Flanders. The
latter he intended to lead in person, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
conduct of the Gascon army he hoped to
delegate to his barons. With the intention
of securing their consent he <span class="sidenote">Struggle
with the
barons over
service in
Gascony</span> called a meeting
of the baronage at Salisbury for the 24th
February. Neither the clergy nor the knights
and burgesses were present. The barons held
freshly in mind the recent opposition of the
clergy and they were in no mood to forego any
tightening of the royal bonds upon themselves.</p>

<p>Edward urged them to go into Gascony,
and straightway one by one they began to
make excuses. To the king, burning to defend
the English possessions abroad and
already overwrought by the long struggle
with the churchmen, the refusal savored of
disloyalty, and in requital he threatened them
with forfeiture of their lands. The two great
earls Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk and
Marshal of England, and Humfrey Bohun of
Hereford, the Constable, were quite as backward
in meeting the king’s wishes and no
more favorably received.</p>

<p>“With you, O King,” said Earl Roger, “I
will gladly go: as belongs to me by hereditary
right, I will go in the front of the host before
your face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“But without me,” Edward assured, “you
will go with the rest.”</p>

<p>“Without you, O King,” Earl Roger declared,
“I am neither bound to go, nor will I.”</p>

<p>“By God, Earl,” swore the king, “You
shall either go or hang!”</p>

<p>“By the same oath, O King, I will neither
go nor hang!”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>In these words and on these grounds the
Earl Marshal of England refused to undertake
foreign service, and the Council scattered.
Edward, not to be undone, straightway set
about preparing for an expedition independently
of his baronage. <span class="sidenote">Seizure
of wool</span> He laid hands upon
all the wool and woolfells of the country,
that being the commodity most readily convertible
into money, and ordered that it be
carried to the seaports. In default of obedience,
this wool passed to the crown by confiscation.
Every merchant who was the possessor
of more than five sacks received tallies
from the royal commissioners which might
or might not secure payment in the future.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Those who had less than five sacks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>allowed to retain it upon paying a toll of
forty shillings on the sack. Simultaneously,
Edward directed at every county a demand
for 2000 quarters of wheat, a like quantity of
oats, and a supply of beef and pork. Whereas
in 1294 Edward had been able to plead the
consent of the merchants to his toll on wool,
in the present instance no plea was possible
save the exigencies of the case, and that was
no defense at law. So Edward, by stress of
circumstance, was obliged to forfeit the support
of a growing and exceedingly important
body of his people.</p>

<p>The king determined to make a final attempt
to win the barons from their contumacy.
For the 7th July, he summoned the
whole fighting force of the kingdom to London;
the assembly was to include all who held
lands to the annual value of £20, no matter
what the tenure.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> From these a demand for
foreign service was obviously unconstitutional,
since they were not immediately bound to
him. Coupled with the weakness of the king’s
position was the continued opposition of
Bohun and Bigod; they and a large number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>the other barons had surrounded themselves
with a force of knights to the number of fifteen
hundred, and, though they were not as yet
openly hostile, they had been able to shield
their lands from the royal exactions of wool
and wheat.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> When Edward ordered the
Marshal and the Constable to perform their
offices, they refused.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Edward found himself
pitted not only against the King of France,
but also against the church, the merchant
class, and his own baronage. Of these the
church showed itself most amenable to placation.
Edward restored to Archbishop Winchelsey
the lands of the see of Canterbury
which he had confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> To strengthen
further a position which at best was exceedingly
weak, Edward made a dramatic attempt
to win over to his cause the support of the
people.</p>

<p>On the 14th July, a week after his unsuccessful
council with the barons, he appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>on a wooden stage erected in front of the great
hall at Westminster and addressed the populace.
He asked that they forgive the harshness
of his acts, but reminded them that what
money they had given him had gone to subdue
enemies plotting to drive the English tongue
from the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s
appeal to
the people</div>

<p>“Behold,” he cried, his voice choked with
tears, “I am going to expose myself to danger
for your sakes; I pray you, if I return,
receive me as you have me now, and I will
restore to you all that has been taken. But
if I return not,” and at this he brought forward
his son, the young Edward, who was
standing near him on the platform, “crown
my son as your king.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The people threw
up their caps and promised fealty to the king.
The archbishop declared his resolve to be
faithful.</p>

<p>But neither the reconciliation with the
church nor the adherence of the London
populace brought him money, and in so far as
advantage was reckoned in terms of shillings,
Edward was no better off than before his
council of the 7th July. He had recourse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>the old expedient of individual negotiation.
He consulted in a private audience the chief
men still remaining of those who had gathered
for the military levy; he assumed their ability
to grant taxes upon the analogy of a Parliament,
an assumption scarcely reasonable in
view of their depleted numbers.<span class="sidenote">His
financial
expedients</span> Notwithstanding
the fact that Earls Roger and Humfrey
remained obdurate, such of the barons
and knights as were there granted an eighth
and the citizens and burghers a fifth, on the
somewhat hazy understanding that the king
should confirm the charters. Edward on the
30th July gave orders for the collection of
the tax and issued writs for the seizure of
8000 sacks of wool, for which the merchants
received tallies as a record of credit at the
exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Then he went down to the coast and prepared
to embark. Putting great faith in the
continued support of the people, he addressed
to them an eloquent plea for loyalty to the
crown as against the barons. He spoke of
the exactions of money to which they had been
subjected, and declared that, severe as was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>the pain which had been inflicted upon the
people, equally great was his own distress;
that the money had been spent for “le commun
profit du reaume, pur son pople honyr et
destruyre.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
The barons, <span class="sidenote">The
barons’
grievances</span> on the other hand,
immediately came forward with a list of
grievances which they presented to the king,
complaining, amongst other things, of the
aids, tallages, and prises which the king had
lately levied. So afflicted were they with
“divers tallages, aids, and prises,” such as
those upon corn, oats, malt, wool, hides, oxen,
kine, and salt meat, that it would have been
impossible for them to equip for any foreign
expedition. More than that, they could make
no grant of an aid, because of their great
poverty following the exaction of the aforesaid
tallages and prises; indeed, there were
“many who had no sustenance, and who
could not till their lands.” The tax on wool
was much too heavy, no less than 40<i>s.</i> on the
sack; wool comprised half the wealth of the
nation, and the tax was equivalent to a fifth
part of the value of the whole land. Magna
Carta and the Charter of the Forest were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>both disregarded, and many acts were done
in defiance of them.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Edward did not return a definite answer;
the call to war sounded too loudly. Before he
embarked he issued orders for the collection of
<span class="sidenote"> Edward
embarks
for
Flanders</span>
a third of clerical temporalities in a most peremptory
manner; on the 10th August the clergy
had expressed hopes of being able to gain the
Pope’s permission to disregard the provisions
of “Clericis laicos,” but of late they had showed
a disposition to stand with the baronage. Finally,
on the 22d August, Edward succeeded
in getting up sail and made for Flanders.</p>

<p>But he could not escape the issue. Almost
before England had sunk below his horizon
Bohun and Bigod were at the Exchequer
loudly protesting against the collection of the
aid which had been irregularly granted to
Edward five weeks previously. They went
to the extreme of forbidding the Barons of
the Exchequer to proceed with their work of
taking the tax until Edward should make
formal confirmation of the Charters.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Londoners forgot their loyalty to the king,
and swore by the earls. The young Prince
Edward, afterward king, whom Edward had
left as his regent, tried to throw a dam across
the swelling river by promising that the
eighth should not be taken into precedent.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
This was published in proclamation on the
28th August, but it availed nothing. The
fifth which had been asserted as owing from
the cities and boroughs was lost sight of.</p>

<p>Edward, two days before his departure for
Flanders had sent out summonses to a number
of barons and knights to meet his son on the
8th September at Rochester. But before that
date was reached, the necessity for a full Council
was apparent. Accordingly, on the 8th
September, messages were sent out which
called most of the barons of the royal party;
on the 9th, Archbishop Winchelsey, the Constable
and the Marshal, were summoned,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
and on the 15th letters were addressed to the
sheriffs ordering an election of knights of
the shire.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> No representatives of the cities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>and boroughs or of the inferior clergy were
called.</p>

<p>The Parliament was summoned for the
octaves of St. Michael (the 6th October), at
London. The great nobles, coming with
their train of armed soldiers, both foot and
horse, had command of the situation.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> They
demanded that the young regent confirm
Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest,
together with certain supplementary articles.
Prince Edward, acting on the advice of his
councillors, agreed, and straightway on the
10th October, sent the Charters and the new
<span class="sidenote">Principle
that grants
must await
redress of
grievances</span>
provisions to his father in Flanders for final
confirmation. Nor was that enough. “The
earls,” says Bishop Stubbs, “took advantage
of their strength to force on the government
the principle, which both before and long
after was a subject of contention among
English statesmen, that grievances must be
redressed before supplies are granted.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The
irregular and much disputed grant of an
eighth they declared null, and in place of it
they substituted a ninth from such of the laity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>as were in attendance, a grant in which the
towns subsequently were included. Here
was one of the opening battles in the war
which was to decide whether or not Parliament,
sitting guardian of the public purse,
could by reason of that guardianship, establish
its control over the executive as well as the
legislative acts of the nation.</p>

<p>The articles found the king at Ghent on the
5th November and he set his name both to the
Charters and to the provisions supplementary
to them. The difficulties with the barons thus
concluded, it was not long before the clerical
atmosphere cleared also.<span class="sidenote">Confirmation
of the
Charters</span> On the 20th November,
the clergy, in response to a suggestion from
Archbishop Winchelsey, evading the letter of
“Clericis laicos,” initiated a tax upon themselves,
a fifth from the northern province, and
a tenth from the southern.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The purpose of
the levy was the defense of the realm against
the Scots who had again invaded the north.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward I, when he signed “Confirmatio
Cartarum,” in an inconclusive way handed
over to Parliament the right to consent to all
taxation before it be levied; in other words,
hereafter Parliament had grounds upon which
it could contest arbitrary exactions of the
crown. That the grounds for objection were
not absolute and that Edward left a loophole
by which he could escape will appear upon a
consideration of the articles themselves.</p>

<p>The first four chapters of Confirmatio
Cartarum have to do with the bare reissuance
of the Charter of Henry III, and penalties
for their infraction. The fifth is more to the
point; it provides that the recent exactions
shall not be taken into precedent for future
taxation.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The sixth chapter brings the issue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>directly before us and exhibits also the loophole
by which <span class="sidenote">The tax
provisions
of Confirmatio
Cartarum</span> the king might find his escape
from it, if he should have the inclination and
the power to do so. It says that “for no business
from henceforth we shall take of our
realm such manner of aids, tasks, nor prises,
but by the common assent of all the realm,
and for the common profit thereof, saving the
ancient aids and prises due and accustomed.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
The chapter going on in reference to the evil
custom of forty shillings on every sack of wool,
commonly known as the “maletolt,” says,
“We ... have granted that we will not take
such thing nor any other without their common
assent and good will; saving to us and our
heirs the custom of wools, skins, and leather,
granted before by the commonalty aforesaid.”</p>

<p>The chapters are explicit. Of the two, the
sixth is of far greater consequence, both to
those seeking in Confirmatio Cartarum a
complete statement of the right of Parliament
to exercise exclusive control over taxation and
to those looking for a vindication of the royal
prerogative. The fifth can be taken for what
it was, a mere promise on the part of the king
not to bring forward past wrongs in defense
of future ills,&mdash;a promise, the like of which
was seldom of much practical avail. The
sixth, however, were it not for two clauses
saving to the king “the ancient aids and prises,
due and accustomed,” and the “custom of
wools, skins, and leather granted before,”
would have established a tolerably broad
basis for the theory that royal control over
taxation underwent its legal death in 1297.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
The facts, however, that the king could still
retain his right to levy ancient aids and prises,
provided they were what his ancestors were
wont to exact; that he could claim unquestioned
control over the wool-tax to the extent
of half a mark on the sack; and that nothing
was said at all about his right to tallage his
demesne and the city of London, form a
sound backing for the contention that not
only was the royal power over taxation not
dead, but that it was still vigorous and capable
of much future activity. One might rightfully
deduce, also, at least in so far as an explicit
reading of the text can lead one to conclusions,
that within certain circumscribed limits, the
royal prerogative would be unquestioned.</p>

<p>By implication, however, it is possible to
read into Confirmatio Cartarum a different
significance than a bald consideration of its
contents allows. The mere fact that the
nation had taken a stand on the matter of
taxation marks the year 1297 as of profound
importance; the fact that the stand was not
conclusive, that it did not represent the fullest
advance possible at the time, is not to be
wondered at. Furthermore, the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Parliaments saw to it that the king observed
more than the mere letter of the law, notwithstanding
Edward’s evident aptitude for
only that. The case in this respect was not
unlike the observance of the omitted chapters
of Magna Carta; though the written form of
them had been misunderstood and unappreciated,
yet by the natural forces at play between
king and Councils, the spirit of them
survived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">De tallagio
non concedendo</div>

<p>The so-called Statute <i>De tallagio non concedendo</i>,
if it could be taken at its face value,
provided exactly those restraints upon the
royal power wherein Confirmatio Cartarum
was wanting. It appears in the Chronicle
of Walter of Hemingburgh immediately after
the French text of Confirmatio Cartarum
under the heading “Articuli incerti in Magna
Carta,”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> “No tallage or aid,” it says, “shall
be laid or levied by us or our heirs in our realm,
without the good will and assent of the archbishops,
bishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses,
and other freemen of our realm.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Seizure of corn, wool, and leather was provided
against, and the maletolt was forever
done away with. Humfrey Bohun and Roger
Bigod received pardon for themselves and
their following for failing to serve in the train
of Edward when he went to Flanders.</p>

<p><i>De tallagio non concedendo</i> was denominated
a statute in the Petition of Right and
declared to be such by decision of the judges,
in the Hampden case in 1637. In all probability,
however, it is nothing but the Latin
abstract of Confirmatio Cartarum, included
by Walter of Hemingburgh in his narrative
for the greater convenience of the reader,
together with a formal statement of the pardon
of the two earls. That Edward did not feel
himself bound by the restrictions of the
“Statute” is shown by the fact that in 1304
he tallaged the towns and the royal demesne.
Furthermore, the nation seems at the time
not to have regarded the Chronicler’s articles
as law, for they registered no complaint
against Edward’s tallage.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>The appearance of Confirmatio Cartarum
marked a stage in the history of parliamentary
taxation. During the reigns of Henry III and
Edward, machinery was constructed which
could carry out the chapters of Magna Carta
providing for taxation by assent. The Parliament
of the three estates, assembled for the
purpose of meeting the pecuniary necessities
of the king, proved itself to be the easiest and
most effective means by which the whole nation
could grant taxes. But the evolution from
the Commune Concilium, the rough prototype
of Parliament, had scarcely gone farther
than to supply a convenient instrument of taxation.
In 1297 every tax did not need the
assent of Parliament as the prerequisite to
its levy; Confirmatio Cartarum was not all-inclusive.
More than that, the question was
still undetermined as to whether the granting
of supplies should always wait upon redress of
grievances. If Parliament should maintain
that principle in practice, then its hold would
be secure upon the executive. Power in 1297
was not far from a balance between king and
nation.</p>

<p>If the evolution of a government can ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
be attributed to the directing skill of man
rather than to the slow weaving of events,
the construction for England of an engine
of popular taxation can be ascribed to Edward
Plantagenet, and in less degree to the
drafter of the working plan, Simon de Montfort.
Edward perceived the nation’s problem
and adapted such means as lay near his hand
to its solution. So it was that an assembly,
not only of the magnates of the kingdom, but
of elected knights of the shire, of parish priests
from the inferior clergy, of merchant citizens
and burgesses from the towns, came together
to provide in common for the common need.</p>

1297-1461</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> years subsequent to 1297 up to the time
of the Tudors comprise a period of differentiation
within Parliament itself. Save for
the event of the year 1340, when the statute
was passed which completed the movement
punctuated by Confirmatio Cartarum, to the
effect that every form of taxation must have
the sanction of Parliament in order to be
legal, the three centuries showed greater
progress inside the walls of Parliament than
beyond them. Struggles there were in plenitude
between king and Parliament <span class="sidenote">Character
of the
period</span> to secure
adherence in practice to the theory enunciated
in 1340, but the great question was that of
the ruling power within Parliament. It is
during this period that the Commons come
forward as the sole initiators of taxes, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to the Lords merely the coördinate power
of consent. In close interrelation with this
monopoly of power over the public purse,
comes, in consequence of the theory that
supplies must wait upon redress of grievances,
the advance toward control by the House of
Commons of the entire machinery of government,
legislative and executive.</p>

<p>It is a period of confusion and contradiction.
Time and again constitutional life
seems to be dead. War, disputed succession
to the crown, tyranny, slip-shod government,&mdash;these
and more tend to make the years 1297-1461
a bundle of scenes ill-bound together.
The Wars of the Roses, the struggles with
France for various causes and with varied
consequences, the doting of monarchs upon
foreign favorites, all contribute toward popular
distraction from that interest in government,
that keen hostility to maladministration,
which makes for constitutional progress.
There was no leader to prick the public conscience;
no Simon de Montfort or Edward
Plantagenet to inaugurate reforms in the
great matters of government.</p>

<p>When Edward I put his name to Confirmatio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Cartarum at Ghent, on the 5th November,
1297, he had still ten years to live. In 1301,
he re-confirmed the Charters in a bill of some
twelve articles forced from him by the barons
in a manner which he denounced as outrageous,
and thereby concluded the baronial
conflict. The barons presented their claims
at the Parliament of Lincoln <span class="sidenote">The Parliament
of
Lincoln,
1301</span> which was
summoned for the 20th January, 1301, and
included amongst them, beside the plea for a
confirmation of the Charters, a demand for
the enforcement of general reforms, this last
to be the prerequisite for a grant of money. A
fifteenth of all movables was then voted to
the king, to be paid upon the completion of
the reforms, the date proposed being Michaelmas
next coming.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The clergy, who still professed
adherence to the bull “Clericis laicos,”
with the approval of the baronage averred that
they could not acquiesce in any grant of money
in the face of papal prohibition. Edward, in
his reply to the claims made by the barons,
declared his unwillingness to admit the validity
of the assertion that papal consent was
necessary to the clerical grant. His confirmation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>of the Charters was dated 14th February,
1301.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Edward’s last years were years of financial
difficulty. In 1302 at the Parliament held
on the 1st July, at London, he received from
the lay estates and the clergy a fifteenth of temporal
goods.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The same year saw him turn
back to the aid <i>pur fille marier</i> <span class="sidenote">Edward’s
financial
expedients</span> which the
barons had granted twelve years previously in
June, 1290; and in 1303 he attempted to obtain
the consent of the merchants to an increase
in the custom on wine, wool, and merchandise.
He called a meeting at York, quite irregular
in its constitutional aspect, and presented the
matter for its consideration. The merchants
would not listen to the plea and the matter,
as far as denizens were concerned, was
dropped.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Five months previously, on the
1st February, Edward had had better fortune
in a similar effort with the foreign merchants.
On the principle that the crown had the right
to close the ports to merchant strangers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Edward entered into negotiation with the
leading men amongst them, and in return
for a grant of all the privileges and liberties
essential to them, they agreed to a fifty per
cent. increase over the rates paid upon wools
and leather by English-born merchants. Beside
these were new duties <span class="sidenote">Tunnage
and poundage
and
other customs</span> upon other commodities,
whether they be exported or imported:
wine, 2<i>s.</i> on the tun, a custom which was to
achieve notoriety under the name of tunnage;
cloth, from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> on the piece depending
upon the dye; general merchandise, 3<i>d.</i> in
the pound of 20<i>s.</i>, subsequently called poundage;
and wax, 1<i>s.</i> per quintal.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> This agreement
between king and merchants, known by
the title “Carta Mercatoria,” was not technically
in contravention of Confirmatio Cartarum,
notwithstanding the provisions of the latter
against the levying without national consent
of any but the “ancient prises” and the custom
on wool previously granted. Confirmatio
Cartarum was a grant to Englishmen and to
Edward’s sharply legal mind, its liberties did
not extend to foreigners, however closely knit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>their relations might be with the king’s own
people.</p>

<p>In 1304 Edward took from the demesne
cities and boroughs and the royal demesne
a sixth of movables.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The records of the

bishops, prelates, earls, barons, and
other good men of the land, praying that the
king wills to grant them the power to tallage
their ancient demesne ... even as the king
has tallaged his demesne, it was answered,
‘Let it be as petitioned.’”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> This is all but

<p>The great Edward died at Burgh-upon-Sands
on Friday, the 7th July, 1307, and the
sceptre fell into the nerveless hand of Edward II.
<span class="sidenote">Edward II,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>great attributes nor his good fortune; he was
improvident and unperceptive, the faithful
dupe of advantage-seeking associates, the lavish
spender of money he did not have, the
chief enemy of himself. At last, when he
had reigned some twenty years, he was put
down and his son succeeded in his stead. Edward
II’s accession was undisputed; at Carlisle,
on the 20th July, he received the homage
and fealty of the English baronage, and six
months later on the 25th February, 1308, he
was crowned. The coronation oath he was
obliged to take in French, not being familiar
with the Latin tongue. The oath was more
than usually stringent; the last of the four
promises required of the king was this:
“Sire, do you grant to hold and to keep the
laws and righteous customs which the community
of your realm shall have chosen,
and will you defend and strengthen them to
the honor of God, to the utmost of your
power?” Edward answered, “I grant and
promise.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Edward did not call a Parliament between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
October 1307, and April 1309.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He was in
fear, apparently, of an attack upon his foreign
favorite, Piers Gaveston, and was desirous
of shielding him, as Charles I attempted to
shield Buckingham three centuries later, by
doing without a Parliament. The only merit
of the favorite seems to have been the deep,
and in its consequences the pathetic love with
which he inspired the young monarch. He
was self-seeking, avaricious, willful, and capable
of exercising a domination over the king
as complete as it was profitable to himself. At
last, however, the loans, which his Italian
bankers, the Friscobaldi had supplied Edward,
withered away and he was obliged to issue
a summons to a Parliament.</p>

<p>Parliament met on the 27th April, 1309,
with a full attendance of clergy, lords, knights
and burgesses. In response to Edward’s
urgent request for funds, the lords, burgesses
and knights granted him a meagre twenty-fifth,
but only on condition of a redress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>grievances, these being detailed in a schedule
of eleven articles.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Two of the eleven
have to do with taxation; the first was directed
at the abuses of purveyance; the second hit
more nearly, having to do with the New
Customs which Edward I had provided for
in the Carta Mercatoria of 1303.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> “And as
to the customs which the king taketh by his
officers&mdash;,” so goes the memorandum in the
Rolls,<span class="sidenote">Tentative
abolition of
the New
Customs</span> “that is to say, of every tun of wine,
two shillings; of every cloth which alien merchants
bring into his land, two shillings; and
of every pound value of avoir de pois, three
pence&mdash;the king willeth at the request of the
said good people that the said customs of wines,
clothes, and avoir de pois, do cease at his will,
in order to know and be advised what profit
and advantage will accrue to him and his
people by ceasing the taking of those customs;
and the king will have counsel according to
the advantage which he shall see therein: saving
always to the king the ancient prises and
customs anciently due and approved.” The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>king gave orders that the conditional grant of
the twenty-fifth be collected.</p>

<p>The trouble over Gaveston, however, was
not settled, and he became increasingly worrisome
to the barons. Furthermore the customs
were collected not by Englishmen but by
Edward’s Italian bankers. <span class="sidenote">The
Lords Ordainers,
1309-1311</span> In March 1310,
meeting in council, the barons drew up a petition
praying against the impoverishment of
the exchequer despite grants of money; the
king, so they said, was still exacting prises
and living by purveyance contrary to the engagement
of 1309. Edward, still hoping to
shield Gaveston, assented to the election of
a commission of twenty-one, known as the
Lords Ordainers, who exercised his authority
for the space of a year and a half.</p>

<p>The Lords Ordainers, recalling in their composition
and purposes those who put forward
the scheme of reform in the Provisions of Oxford
of 1255, proceeded to promulgate ordinances
for the correction of abuses. On the
2d August, 1310, six ordinances were made
public and received the confirmation of the
king.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> By the fourth, it was ordained “that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>the customs of the realm be kept and received
by people of the realm, and not by aliens; and
that the issues and profits of the same customs,
together with all other issues and profits of
the realm arising from any matters whatsoever,
shall come entirely to the King’s exchequer,
... to maintain the household of
the king, and otherwise to his profit, so that
the king may live of his own, without taking
prises other than those anciently due and
accustomed; and all others shall cease.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Despite the apparent inclusion of the “New
Customs” within the meaning of this ordinance,
their resumption was ordered the same
day, on the ground that during the period of
their prohibition, prices had not been reduced.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Parliament met on the 8th August, 1311,
to receive the final report of the Ordainers,
and sat for two months. Thirty-five additional
articles were drawn up in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>

customs have been levied,” says the ordinance,
“and the old enhanced, as upon wools, cloths,
wines, avoir de pois, and other things, whereby
the merchants come more seldom, and bring
fewer good into the land, and the foreign merchants
abide longer than they were wont to do,

than they were wont to be, to the damage of
the king and his people; we do ordain that
all manner of customs and imposts levied
since the coronation of King Edward, son of
King Henry, be entirely put out, and altogether
extinguished for ever, notwithstanding
the charter which the said King Edward made
to the merchant aliens, because the same was
made contrary to the Great Charter ...,

for each sack of wool, half a mark, and for
three hundred woolfells, half a mark, and for

On the 9th October, the day upon which Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>rose, the order went out which made
the ordinance effective.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Banishment

Gaveston</div>

<p>Gaveston, the hated favorite, whose corruption
and acts of oppression had furnished the
immediate cause for the reform movement,
was amply provided for. He was put under
sentence of perpetual banishment and in
order to safeguard themselves against the
return to power of him and his kind, the
barons reiterated the demand made in 1244,
that the appointment of ministers be subject
in the future to their council and consent.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
The king gave his assent to the ordinances on
the 30th September and two weeks later they
went out to the sheriffs for publication.</p>

<p>The Parliament which met in 1312 granted
Edward no money. His position was desperate
and he turned everywhere in the hope that he
could raise funds wherewith to meet his necessities;
the merchants and the clergy, even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Pope, were induced to lend him money. But
they could not satisfy his needs; therefore in
December, 1312,<span class="sidenote">Tallage of
1312:
Riots in
London
and Bristol</span> the Council determined to
levy a tallage on the demesne towns and the
royal demesne of a fifteenth of movables and
a tenth of rents.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The imposition met with
opposition, resistance being most riotous in
London and Bristol. The objections which
the people of Bristol raised were not based
upon legal grounds; it so happened that at
the moment certain of their burgesses were
confined in the Tower of London, and that
grievance, so they maintained, warranted their
refusal. The basis for resistance raised by
the citizens of London was not so casual; they
claimed immunity from a royal tallage on
the ground of the “ancient privileges” guaranteed
to them under Magna Carta. Neither
cited <i>De tallagio non concedendo</i> as the defense
of their actions, and the presumption against
the validity of the so-called statute is therefore
enhanced. The king secured his payment by
way of compromise; the Londoners granted a
“loan” of £400 and another of £1000, from
which sums they were to be relieved at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>time of collection of the next general aid.
Many other towns escaped upon the ground
that they were not situated within the royal
demesne. The principle that the king could
levy tallages upon his own demesne thus
remained unquestioned; but no tallage was
levied during the rest of this reign.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

more as the result of stress in his own household
than because of any strain which he put
upon the constitution. Favorites, an unfaithful
wife, and factions which he bred among
his barons, did more to bring about his dethronement
and his subsequent murder than
any condition of taxation. In the list of
grievances which Bishop Stratford drew up as
furnishing cause sufficient for the overthrow
of Edward, nothing appears which has any
connection with the question of taxation,
much less any assertion of parliamentary right
to control it. The king consented to the
election of his son in his stead on January 20,
1327. Eight months thereafter he died; few
doubt that he was murdered.</p>

<p>The reign of Edward III dates from the
24th January, 1327. <span class="sidenote">Edward III,

so dominant a control over the young king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
that the influence of the Council was nil.
Edward went through the formality of confirming
the charters and forbidding illegal
assessment of aids. His rule really did not
begin until November, 1330, when Mortimer
was killed.</p>

<p>Edward III, being no statesman, but a
warrior, energetic, without scruple, lavish,
and ambitious, was not a figure designed to
loom large in constitutional history. He did
not mould events as did his grandfather; he
watched them move. As a matter of fact there
was advance. Tallage was prohibited and
there came, too, the abolition in law of other
forms of arbitrary taxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Parliament met three months later, on the
9th September, and a request formulated by
the prelates, earls, barons, and the knights
of the shires, was addressed to the king praying
the recall of the commission for the
tallage; Parliament offered as a substitute a
fifteenth from the shires and a tenth from
the towns. Just why a Parliament in which
the Rolls do not note the inclusion of the
burgesses should accomplish such a substitution,
which obviously benefited the townsmen,
is not clear, unless a considerable portion of the
knights dwelt within the royal demesne or in
small towns formerly subjected to the exaction
of tallage. In his acceptance of the grant
Edward promised for the future that he would
not lay such a tallage, “Except as was customary
in the time of our ancestors, and as
he might rightly do.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> It was not, however,
until the sweeping legislation of 1340 that tallage
became illegal.</p>

<p>In parallel to the struggle against tallaging
the royal demesne was the contest with
the king in the matter of the custom on
wool. Edward in 1328 confirmed the reëstablished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
scale of 1322 <span class="sidenote">New
Customs become a regular means of
revenue</span> which his father in his
hour of supremacy had laid upon the alien
merchants, in amount equal to the “nova
custuma” of Edward I. From this time the
New Customs became a part of the regular
revenue of the crown, though Parliament did
not yield its sanction until a time some fifty
years after the first levy, when, in 1353, it
gave its assent to the Statute of Staples.</p>

<p>But the regulation of the relations between
king and merchant denizens, and incidentally
through them, his relations (aside from the
New Customs) with the aliens, is not so
briefly told. Throughout the reign of Edward
III the question was being quietly fought
out as to whether or not the king might tamper
with the wool customs irrespective of parliamentary
sanction. In 1332 Edward issued
an ordinance which provided for the collection
of a subsidy on the wool of denizens; the
rate was to be half a mark on the sack and 300
woolfells, and twenty shillings on the last of
leather. A year later on the 30th June, 1333,
Edward recalled his ordinance, but he did not
relinquish his grasp upon the customs; by
negotiation with the merchants, he received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
ten shillings on the sack and 300 woolfells
and a pound on the last. In order to bolster
up the legality of the proceeding, he issued
a royal ordinance to the same effect.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The wool
customs</div>

<p>In August of the year 1336, when the king’s
arms were meeting with great success on the
northern border, Edward, confident in his
popularity, sent out royal letters forbidding
the export of wool.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Parliament met at Nottingham
the following month full of pride
in the military prowess of the king, and
granted him liberal aids. Not only did the
barons and knights contribute a twentieth,
the towns a tenth, the clergy a sixth, but the
merchants, who were at this moment, so it
appeared, on the verge of attaining to the
dignity of a fourth estate in Parliament,
granted him forty shillings on the sack of
wool; and the foreign merchants were to pay
an additional twenty shillings.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In the hope
that its action would encourage the domestic
manufacture of cloth, Parliament in March,
1337, passed a statute forbidding the exportation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>of wool, and offering foreign operatives
special inducements to settle in England.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The
embargo was to continue until the king and his
Council should decide otherwise. Thus empowered,
Edward and his Council issued an
ordinance imposing upon denizens a custom
of £2 on the sack and on 300 woolfells, and £3
on the last of leather; the unfortunate aliens
were to pay double.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The effect upon the people was immediate;
unable to sympathize with the project of
importing skilled labor and seeing only the
curtailment in profits normally accruing from
their chief article of export, they were led
almost to the point of revolt. The Parliament
which met in September 1339, in answer to
the general cry for reform, brought forward
measures aimed to allay the popular irritation.
The barons made the curious grant of
“the tenth sheaf, the tenth lamb, and the
tenth fleece, payable in two years,” and they
“willed that the maletolt of wool lately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>levied afresh, be entirely removed and held
to the old rate.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The knights and burgesses,
questioning their ability to grant money to
the king without first consulting their constituents,
desired the matter deferred to a subsequent
Parliament. They mentioned six grievances
upon which they demanded redress.
They asked release from the customary aids
and prises, and “that the maletolt of wool and
lead be taken as of old, for that the same
is now increased without the assent of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
The new Parliament, in accordance
with the will of the knights and burgesses,
was summoned for the 20th January, 1340.</p>

<p>At this session no new legislation was undertaken.
Edward was abroad and his absence
discouraged the members from enunciating
new principles. They showed themselves,
however, sympathetic with the royal necessities.
The lords again offered the tenth sheaf,
the tenth fleece, and the tenth lamb; the commons
granted 30,000 sacks of wool, on the
condition of the royal acceptance of certain
articles drawn by them, and in case their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>reforms were not favored by the king, they
made a free gift of 2500 sacks of wool.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
Edward called a new Parliament which met
the 29th March, there being in attendance a
large body of merchants. The prelates, barons,
and knights made a gift of the ninth sheaf,
fleece, and lamb in complement to the baronial
tenth of the previous January, and the towns
gave a ninth of movables; a fifteenth from the
rest of the nation, such as had no wool and yet
were not townsfolk, completed the grant, save
for a custom on each sack of wool, on every
300 woolfells, and on every last of leather,
of forty shillings.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
But the gifts were conditional;
the king was to accept the articles
prepared by the commons. Being amenable
to their will, he referred the petitions to a
committee, part of which was selected by the
commons themselves, with the understanding
that it should draw up statutes embracing
such of the matters prayed for as were of a
permanent character.</p>

<p>The first statute met the demands of 1339.
“And for this grant,” it says, speaking of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
liberal wool subsidy mentioned above,<span class="sidenote">Statutory
abolition
of the
maletolt
and of all
unauthorized
taxation</span> “the
king by the assent of the prelates, earls,
barons, and all others assembled in Parliament,
hath granted, that from the feast of
Pentecost that cometh in a year, he nor his
heirs shall not demand, assess, nor take, nor
suffer to be taken more custom of a sack of
wool of any Englishman but half a mark of
custom only; and upon woolfells and leather
the old custom.... And this establishment
lawfully to be holden and kept, the king hath
promised in the presence of the prelates, earls,
barons, and others in his Parliament, no more
to charge, set, or assess, upon the custom,
but in the manner as afore is said.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The second statute was still more sweeping:
“We ... will and grant for us and our heirs,
to the same prelates, earls, barons, and commons,
citizens, burgesses, and merchants ...
that they be” not “from henceforth charged
nor grieved to make common aid, or to sustain
charge, if it be not by the common assent
of the prelates, earls, barons, and other great
men, and commons of our said realm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
England, and that in the Parliament; and
that all the profits rising from the said aid,
and of the wards and marriages, customs,
and escheats, and other profits rising of the
said realm of England, shall be put and
spent upon the maintenance of the safeguard
of our said realm of England and of
our wars....”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The importance of these two acts is readily
apparent. The promise of Edward to abide
by the recommendation of Parliament in the
matter of the subsidy on wool, was an admission
by the king that not he but they had
final control over the laying of customs duties.
Thus was established the principle to be
defended and likewise to be questioned in
the future, that Parliament alone had power
to lay a tax on wool. In the second place, by
the statute which provided that no charge or
aid should be levied but by consent of Parliament,
tallage died a legislative death.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>not only was this statute aimed at tallages
but as well at every species of unauthorized
taxation. <span class="sidenote">Parliament
the
sole taxing
authority
in law</span> Thus was enunciated the profoundly
important principle that Parliament was the
sole authority for levying taxes not merely
on the nation at large, as had long been the
practice, but in every department of the government,
on the royal demesne as readily as on
the shires themselves. If the practice of future
years had lived up to the ideal expressed in
this statute, it would be possible to draw a
line at the year 1340 and say that thereafter
Englishmen exercised the right of taxing
themselves.</p>

<p>The commons perceived, apparently, that
the incidence of indirect taxation fell upon
the nation quite to the same degree as direct
taxation. The customs, in the beginning
undisputedly within the royal prerogative,
and according to royalistic advocates unceasingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
so up to relatively modern times, were
contended for almost as heartily as power
over direct taxation itself. “The history of
the customs,” says Bishop Stubbs, “illustrates
the pertinacity of the commons as well as the
evasive policy of the supporters of prerogative.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Prior to the accession of Edward III,
the struggle for control, centering upon exactions
in excess of the <i>antiquæ custumæ</i>, was
quietly waged between king and Parliament.
During his reign and afterward the watchfulness
of Parliament kept up.</p>

<p>After the legislation of 1340, Parliament
showed itself willing to bargain with the king
for control of the customs duties, thus staying
within its legal rights. It could only petition,
it could not yet enforce; and when the king
promised his assent to a petition he frequently
forgot his word. An account of what became
of the custom on wool is illuminating as <span class="sidenote">Checkered
history of
the wool
customs</span> indicative
of the variation between petition and enforcement.
In 1340, the king had received
by grant of Parliament forty shillings on the
sack, for a year and a half, on the understanding
that he would abolish the maletolt. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>a lapse of two years,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Edward procured from
the merchants without the consent of the
commons, a custom of forty shillings on the
sack and issued orders for its collection. The
commons, exhibiting more than an elementary
knowledge of economic principles, perceived
that the tax fell not upon the foreign merchants,
but upon the growers of wool. In
response to the remonstrance of the commons
made in the Parliament of May, 1343,
Edward declared to them that the price to
be paid for wool, being fixed by the authority
of Parliament, would be constant, and that
consequently the foreign merchants would
feel the incidence of the tax.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The commons,
duly impressed by so subtle an argument,
consented to a reimposition of the exaction
for three years under the sanction of Parliament.
After the passing of the three years,
and the ordinance fixing the price of wool
having in the meantime been revoked,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> the
commons, finding that Edward showed no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>disposition to release wool from the custom,
petitioned against its continuance.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The king
replied that he had secured the assent of the
baronage and of the merchants, and that he
had already pledged the proceeds of it to his
creditors. The commons, finding that they
could not win their point, contented themselves
with a belief that having established
the principle, they could at any time demand
a practice of it, and granted the perpetuation
of the old rate for two years. In 1348, at the
conclusion of that term, the commons again
presented a remonstrance, asserting that the
wool subsidy was really a land tax. They
granted a fifteenth for three years on the condition
that the subsidy of wool should cease in
three years, and that for the future “no such
grant should be made by the merchants.”
The wording was particularly conclusive,&mdash;no
“imposition, tallage, or charge by way of
loan or in any other manner,” was to be laid
“without the grant and assent of the commons
in Parliament.” And the enactment was to
remain “as a matter of record, whereby they
may have remedy if anything should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>attempted to the contrary in time to come.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Edward accepted the grant and assented to
most of the petitions, but no new statute was
based upon them, a fact which is taken to
indicate that the oppressions complained of
were recognized as illegal.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Again in 1362 arbitrary exactions on wool
received the attention of the commons and
the statute passed in that year enacted that
thereafter no subsidy should be set on wool
without the assent of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Notwithstanding
the explicit and repeated assertions
by the Commons that Parliament had the
sole right to levy the subsidy, Edward at
intervals exacted the maletolt. The matter
reappeared in 1371 and was greeted with a
similar statute.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>the tunnage and poundage, of clerical grants,
and of the individual subsidies on wool belong
rather to the domain of fiscal history
than to a consideration of the growing power
of the English Parliament to levy taxes.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
The constitutional points receive illustration
most clearly in the narration of the controversy
over wool, since in respect of that and of tallage
new questions were involved. As regards the
rest, Parliament did not more than confirm
itself in habits which it had already formed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appropriation
of
supplies</div>

<p>Side by side with the power to grant taxes
was growing up the faculty for supervising
the expenditure of money so raised. As far
back as the second decade of the reign of
Henry III, in 1237, William of Ralegh had
suggested to the Commune Concilium that
it appoint a committee with whom the proceeds
of a grant be deposited and by whom
the money be expended; that the suggestion
was not taken was owing, perhaps, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>ignorance of the baronage. Edward I was
too strong to permit of being so controlled,
and under Edward II the whole power of the
crown was for a time delegated to others; in
neither reign was the principle of appropriation
of supplies definitely put forward. But
in the time of Edward III, owing doubtless
to the vast sums thrown into his bottomless
war chest, Parliament began to demand a
voice in the disposition of the public funds.
In 1340, as we have seen, it was denominated
in the statute that the “profits of the said
realm of England shall be put and spent upon
the maintenance of the safeguard of our said
realm of England, and of our wars.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The
grants of 1346 and 1348, in so far as they
accrued from the northern counties, were to
be applied to defend the border against the
Scots,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and in 1353 a subsidy on wool was
granted to be applied solely for the purposes
of the war.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not the money was actually
applied according to the direction of Parliament
was another matter. Efforts to ensure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>the carrying out of the parliamentary will
were begun as early as 1340. In that year a
committee of lords and commons was appointed
to examine the accounts of <span class="sidenote">Examination
of accounts</span> William
de la Pole and the other collectors of the last
subsidy.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> In 1341 the Rolls of Parliament
have it that “the great men and commons of
the land pray, for the common profit of the
king and of themselves, that certain persons
be deputed by commission to audit the accounts
of all those who have received the wool
of our said lord, or other aid granted to him;
and also of those who have received and paid
out his money, as well beyond the seas as
in the realm from the commencement of his
war until now; and that the rolls and other
remembrances, obligations, and other things
made abroad be delivered into the chancery,
to be enrolled and recorded, just as was wont
to be done heretofore.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> To the petition the
royal response ran: “It is the king’s pleasure
that this be done by good men deputed for the
purpose, with the addition that the treasurer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>and the chief baron be of the number; and
that it be done concerning this as it was
heretofore ordained; and that the lords be
chosen in this Parliament. And also that all
rolls, remembrances, and obligations made beyond
the sea, be delivered into the chancery.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>There is not much reason to suppose that
Edward adhered to this promise better than
he held to others of a similar character, save
that there appears no complaint from Parliament
until the last year of his reign. In 1377,
in voicing the demand of Peter de la Mare,
the commons in the Good Parliament petitioned
“that it may please our lord the king
to name two earls and two barons, of those
who shall seem to him best, who shall be
guardians and treasurers as well of this subsidy
now granted and of the subsidy which
the clergy of England is yet to grant to the
king our lord, as of the subsidy of wool,
leather, and woolfells granted in the last Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
The lords so chosen were to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>sworn before the commons, and were to
expend the subsidies “for the said wars and
for no other work.” The high treasurer of
England was to have nothing to do with it
in anywise whatsoever. Decisive action, however,
waited upon the next reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Edward
III, 21st
June, 1377</div>

<p>The long life of Edward III came to an end
on the 21st June, 1377. His was a reign which
had seen much war, much poverty, much
famine, and worse than these, the Great
Plague. The time was not well designed, so
it would seem, for constitutional advance, yet
in the direction of parliamentary taxation, the
progress was marked. To be sure, Parliament
had not dared to come into open combat
with the king, and had, in order to preserve
its theoretical power, been many times
obliged to sanction a tax after it had been levied.
Thus did Edward play with Parliament
throughout the argument over the wool tax,
yet the nation did secure the enunciation of
complete parliamentary control over the levying
of taxes of every description in the sweeping
legislation of 1340.</p>

<p>But Parliament had shown a disposition
to reach out after powers which its predecessors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in some instances had exercised and
in others foreshadowed. The history of the
wool customs shows this if it shows nothing
else, that Parliament was inclined to make
supply wait upon redress of grievances; that
the inclination was not a determination was
owing to the fact of Edward’s wars; withholding
supply would wreck English military prestige
far more quickly than the arms of France.
Yet the time was not far distant when the
grant would be reserved until the end of the
session, and thus secure the redress of grievances
before the granting of a supply. By
other means, also, Parliament was reaching
out to control the executive. By appropriating
money for particular purposes, to which
expenditure should be limited, and by demanding
an audit of accounts to insure adherence
to those limitations, the representatives
of the nation were securing for it the control
of the public purse, not only in the department
of income but of outlay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Separate
sessions of
the houses</div>

<p>Throughout the reigns of Edward II and
Edward III a process of differentiation had
been going on within the walls of Parliament
itself, resulting in separate sessions of lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and commons. The process had its beginnings,
indeed, in the time of Edward I, yet no instance
can be pointed to with certainty showing
the separate sessions until 1332. In that
year the Rolls of Parliament speak of distinct
assemblies. In 1339 the division appears
to have become permanent. The House
of Commons in 1352 occupied the Chapter

sessions of lords on the one hand and the
knights of the shires and the burgesses was
the preliminary of the assumption by the two
latter bodies, in name the House of Commons,
of the power of initiating tax legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard II,
1377-1399</div>

<p>Edward III left the throne to the keeping of
a boy, his grandson, the youthful Richard II.
He was only eleven years old at the beginning
of his reign, and only thirty-three when his
brief attempt at absolutism brought him deposition,
and then death. “The fair rose withered,”
as Shakespeare described his dethronement,
but the withering was due to the attempt
of the king, ill-advised and perhaps insane, to
climb too high.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>In the matter of taxation, however, the
chief interest lies in the early part of his reign,
when the years of Richard’s minority gave
the commons opportunity to enforce the exercise
of the principle that taxes should not be
levied without their consent, and to foster the
theories advanced in the previous reign that
they had a right to examine the public accounts
and to appropriate supplies.</p>

<p>In the time of Richard II the examination
of public accounts and the granting of money
for specific purposes, became national issues.
At his first Parliament, that of October, 1377,
grants of two fifteenths and tenths were made
for the prosecution of the French war on the
express condition that two treasurers be appointed
who should see to the due application
of the proceeds.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Trouble
over audit
of accounts</span> The king chose William
Walworth and John Philipot, merchants of
London, the latter of whom is distinguished
as one of the earliest English financiers, and
these swore to perform their duties faithfully.
It was not without difficulty, however, that
the next Parliament, which met in October,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
1378, was able to secure an accounting. The
commons demanded the accounts and for a
time the chancellor attempted evasion, hoping,
so it appears, to shield John of Gaunt who
was suspected of obtaining money from the
treasurers for his private purposes. He was
forced to yield and the accounts were laid open
to criticism, though with the incidental assertion
by the king “that it had never been known
that, of a subsidy or other grant made to the
king in Parliament or out of Parliament by
the commons, an account had afterwards been
rendered to the commons or to any one
else except to the king and his officers.”
More than that, there was to be understanding
“that this shall not in future be considered
a precedent or an inference that this
should have been done otherwise than by
the personal volition and command alone of
our said lord the king....”<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this same Parliament upon
the occasion of its grant to the king, petitioned
that it be expended for the advantage of the
kingdom, and that competent treasurers be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>appointed to keep the accounts.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The thirteen-year-old
king readily fell in with the idea. To
the Parliament of 1379 he sent letters in which
he said, “That you may be fully informed of
the real nature of the said necessary expenditures
made and to be made, the treasurers for
the said war shall be present and shall appear,
at such hour as pleases you, to show you
clearly in writing their receipts and expenditures
made since the last Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The
House of Commons, later during the same Parliament
petitioned for the discharge of the
special treasurers, and prayed that the Treasurer
of England with the Chamberlains of the
Exchequer receive money as “was usual of
old.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Here is an early instance of the individual
action of the House of Commons. But
in 1380, the tide turned back. The commons
who were assuming leadership in the situation,
hearing from the chancellor of the very serious
embarrassment in which the crown found itself,
were stung to the belief that there was extravagance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>in the royal household, or else that
the ministers were incapable. They therefore
prayed the king to allow the election in Parliament
of the chief officers of state.<span class="sidenote">Special
treasurers</span> Richard
responded favorably and the commission was
appointed, with the old treasurers of subsidies,
William Walworth and John Philipot, as
members.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> By 1382 the reversion to the
system of special treasurers was complete,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
and from that time, save at moments of great
national confusion, these officers were regularly
appointed and had as their duties the
keeping of accounts, both of income and
outlay, which were to be presented before
Parliament at its session immediately following.</p>

<p>Over the levy of taxes Parliament, so it
appears, had unquestioned control throughout
the reign;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> the king’s household was vastly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>extravagant and the royal prerogative of
purveyance was exercised to excess, but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in the articles of deposition no word of complaint,
save in the most general terms, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
levelled at the king for laying taxes unlawfully,<span class="sidenote">Taxation
by Parliament</span>
and this remonstrance is unsupported
by specific instances. Indeed, the most violent
outbreak on the score of taxation was against
Parliament itself.</p>

<p>In 1380, Parliament found itself in this
difficult position, that it was under necessity
of supplying an immensely large sum, no less
than £160,000, as speedily as possible. The
French war, an expedition about to be undertaken
against Scotland, and the usual expenses
of the kingdom had so depleted the
royal treasury that the king was sorely embarrassed;
he was greatly in debt and his
jewels were already pawned. The commons
were at a loss to devise the means whereby
so great a sum could be raised, and showed a
disposition to shirk the burden. The lords
undertook it and suggested three methods: a
graduated poll-tax, a custom on merchandise,
or a number of fifteenths and tenths. The
commons, seeing in the first the virtue of
rapid assessment and collection, chose it in
spite of the disappointing proceeds of the
poll-tax of two years previously. A subsidy
on wool, the normal income from which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
amount to £60,000, was to serve as an auxiliary
tax. The clergy undertook to raise a
third of the remaining £100,000, leaving some
£66,667 to accrue from the poll-tax. The
rate varied according to individuals from
sixty groats to three, with an understanding
that the rich should help the poor, but that
in no case should a man pay less than a groat
for himself and his wife.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rising
of the
Villeins</div>

<p>Here was the exciting cause for the Rising
of the Villeins which Bishop Stubbs describes
as “one of the most portentous phenomena to
be found in the whole of our history.”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
Following closely as did the poll-tax of 1380
upon those of 1378 and 1379, both of which
bore heavily upon the lesser people, the impost
set fire to tinder which had been long
preparing for a conflagration. To enter into
an inquiry as to the underlying causes and
the ultimate consequences of this rising, would
be to travel far afield. It is sufficient to observe
that the payment of even so small a sum
as a groat, served to bring freshly to the minds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>of the most ignorant the maladministration in
London, and to arouse in them the impulse,
however ill-advised or ill-directed, to correct
abuses in the executive. The Rising of the
Villeins is illustrative of the not unusual conception
that bad government is chiefly reprehensible
because it is expensive.</p>

<p>The taxation during the years 1389-1397 was
regular and moderate. Richard’s rule for the
time was that of a constitutional monarch and
his Parliaments exercised the power of initiating
taxation without opposition. Parliament
was practicing what it had accomplished in
theory in the long years of struggle since Magna
Carta; it was accustoming itself to the exercise
of the powers which in principle it had acquired.
Fulfillment in fact was following upon
enunciation of principle. Consequently it was
with the greater shock to the nation that Richard
II suddenly changed from his constitutional
habit and took upon himself the powers
of a despot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard’s
despotism
and his dethronement</div>

<p>The temptation came to him as a result
of the action of Parliament itself. In 1398,
following upon its grant the previous year,
of a custom on wool for five years and tunnage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and poundage for three years, it granted the
subsidy on wool, woolfells, and leather to
Richard for the space of his life. Beside this
unprecedented liberality, it gave him as well
a tenth and a half and a fifteenth and a half
for the curious term of a year and a half.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
Nor was this all. It cut off its own head by
delegating its authority to a standing committee
of Parliament. The opening was barely offered
before Richard took advantage of it. With a
revenue for life and a Council subservient to
his will, scarcely ever was there better chance
for despotism; but the acceptance of the opportunity
was the close forerunner of disaster.</p>

<p>With the idea in his head that all was safe
in England, Richard went off to Ireland. This
gave Henry, the heir to the dukedom of Lancaster,
a dream of an unguarded throne to
which he could climb. Estranged by reason
of his disinheritance, he was ready to act as
soon as he saw such a vision. He landed in
Yorkshire, moved southward, receiving allegiance
of the people as he went, and won
away from Richard the powerful supporters
of the throne. Richard, returning, fought a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>battle already lost. He resigned his kingship,
and the nation as represented in Parliament,
accepted his resignation.</p>

<p>The charges against the king, upon which
sentence of deposition was pronounced, were
summed up in thirty-three articles. Only four
of them in any degree concern taxation. These
are: (14) he had not repaid loans made in dependence
upon his solemn promise; (15) he
had alienated the crown estates, and exacted
unlawful taxes and purveyances; (19) he had
tampered with the elections by nominating
the knights whom the sheriffs were to return,
in order to ensure to himself a revenue for
life; (21) he had extorted money from seventeen
whole shires for pretended pardons.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The charges were doubtless colored by enthusiasm
for his deposition. The most serious,
that of unlawful taxation, seems difficult
to substantiate unless it be taken in connection
with the article which asserts that the Parliament
of 1398 was packed for the very purpose
of securing a revenue for life. The complaint
against purveyance seems equally ill-founded;
during the reign of Edward III it had assumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>the proportions of a great abuse of prerogative,
but it was not in the time of his grandson an object
of great concern to the nation. Thomas
of Walsingham, whose tone is somewhat querulous,
gives substance to the charges about
the nonpayment of loans and the exaction
of money for pretended pardons. “Promising
in good faith to repay,” he says, “he
never after gave the money back to his creditors.”
Further, “The clergy and the common
people and the temporal lords were constrained
to give the king sums of money beyond
the strength of man to bear, in order to buy
back his good will.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The step was very short
to the forced loans of the Tudors.</p>

<p>The trouble with Richard was that he did
not go to school to history. Parliament was
putting into practice what it could learn from
the experience of its predecessors. Richard,
swept with a desire, intense and perhaps insane,
to wield the sceptre of absolutism, was
blinded to what he might have read, and underwent
the consequences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry IV,
1399-1413</div>

<p>Henry IV was better advised; at any rate,
he was politic enough to live closely by what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>he had learned. He was suspicious, cautious,
slow and faltering in action save in the one
supreme instance of seizing the throne; an
exceedingly good politician. The power of
Parliament and especially of the commons
during his reign was more complete than
ever before,&mdash;fuller, indeed, than it should be
again until after the final hand-to-hand struggle
with the Stuarts. In the matter of taxation,
instances of illegality are rare; Parliament
continued to exercise the supreme control in
voting taxes; and in the more recently acquired
rights of appropriating supplies and
examining public accounts, the supremacy of
Parliament was established. Not only does
this observation hold good during the reign
of Henry IV, but it is equally applicable to
the two Lancastrians who succeeded him.</p>

<p>In 1400 there appears to have been an
exception to this rule. Henry apparently secured
an aid not from Parliament but from
the Great Council. There was the understanding,
however, that the grant was binding
not upon the nation at large but upon the
members of the Council.</p>

<p>In 1401 the commons attempted to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
dependence of supply upon redress of grievances
a part of the regular parliamentary
procedure. They prayed the king that they
know his responses to petitions before setting
themselves to the business of granting a supply.
Henry met the issue squarely. “On the
last day of the Parliament,” say the Rolls,
“response was made that this manner of deed
had not been seen nor used in the time of any
of his ancestors or predecessors, that they
should have any response to their petitions
or knowledge of the same before they had
taken up and completed all the other business
of Parliament, be it to make any grant or
otherwise. And therefore the king did not
wish in any way to change the good customs
and usages made and used in former times.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Nevertheless, the commons proceeded to put
into practice the substance of their demand
by delaying their grants<span class="sidenote"> Practice of
delaying
grants</span> of supply until the
last day of the session, when the most important
of the petitions would have received answers.
Thus the next Parliament, that which
met on the 30th September, 1402, withheld its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>grant until the 24th November; the session
closed on the 25th and no business was transacted
in the meantime.</p>

<p>The chief advance in the reign of the new
king lay not in a fuller control by Parliament
in the matter of laying taxation; that would
scarcely have been possible. But it lay rather
in a differentiation of powers within Parliament
itself, leading to a more complete supervision
of taxation by the House of Commons.
<span class="sidenote">Initiation
of tax
levies in
the House
of Commons,
1407</span> Since the end of Edward III’s reign the theory
had been practiced that the commons should
exercise a decisive power over the levy of taxes,
as illustrated in the levy of the poll-tax of 1380.</p>

<p>The form of making a grant, “made by the
commons with the assent of the lords spiritual
and temporal” first occurred in the grants to
Richard II in 1395.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Votes of money previous
to that year were made in conjunction with
the House of Lords. The phrase was repeated
in the grants of 1401 and 1402.</p>

<p>In 1407 came the assertion that to the commons
not only belonged decisive power, but
that they alone had the faculty of originating
taxation. It came not as a direct demand for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>the yielding of a principle, but as an implication
that the practice already existed, and as
such it gains in strength.</p>

<p>The trend of events leading up to the significant
reference is interesting. In 1407 the
lords had held a debate in the king’s presence
respecting the condition of the kingdom,
and had determined upon the number of subsidies
needful for national defense. Henry,
for the moment forgetting his politics, in a
peremptory tone requested the commons to
send a delegation to the House of Lords “to
hear and to report to their companions that
which they should have in command of our
lord the king.” The commons sent a committee
of twelve in response to the request;
they heard that “it was the will of our said
lord the King they should report to the rest
of their companions” the determination of
the lords, and that, “they should see to it
that they conformed most nearly to the purpose
of the Lords aforesaid.” When the
delegates returned, their report was received
by the commons as being an infringement
upon their liberties. The king, hearing of
the temper of the commons, reassuming immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
his habit of the politician, “declares,
by the advice and consent of the lords in
manner following,” that it is lawful for both
houses to commune apart by themselves “of
the state of the realm and of the remedy
necessary for the same.” So far the king has
merely recognized the need for separate deliberations
by the two houses; the phrase which
implies the existence in the House of Commons
of the power to initiate taxation is this: “Any
grant by the commons granted, and by the
lords assented to.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Thus is admitted by implication
the order in which a grant should be
made by the two houses. In the same communication
the king renounces any right
which he might previously have held to know
the amount or conditions of a prospective
grant until both houses should be of one
mind. The grant which eased so sweeping an
admission from the king was generous.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> It
consisted of a fifteenth and a half and a tenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>and a half, a subsidy on wool, and tunnage
and poundage for two years.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>In 1410 Henry asked Parliament for permission
to collect a tenth and a fifteenth annually,
whenever Parliament should not be
sitting. Had the request been granted, the
result for a frugal monarch would have been
hardly less than independence of parliamentary
control. He was refused. Without the frequent
necessity of calling a Parliament, Henry’s
last years, instead of their smooth constitutional
trend, might readily have had as tragic
a story as those of Richard II. He died in 1413.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry V,
1413-1422</div>

<p>His son Henry V came to the throne without
dispute, and for a brief nine years fired
the souls of the English people with zest of
conquest and pride of race. A warrior, the
mediæval ideal of a king, he was yet noble
of mind and soul. Had his brilliant career
not so suddenly flickered and gone out, he
might have won a place beside Edward I; as
it was, the constitutional history of his reign
reveals no struggle between people and monarch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>over the sordid wherewithal to fight his
battles; both sides apparently honored the
other. The taxation during his reign was
heavy, but it was voted gladly to the king
who could use it as a means to victory at
Agincourt. Henry V, whom his people loved
enough to make legendary participant in their
revellings, died in France, 31st August, 1422.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry VI,
1422-1461</div>

<p>Henry VI was almost as unfortunate in
his birth as in his death, and his life seemed
to bring him nothing but disaster. He was
barely a year old when his father died, his
troubled reign saw the Wars of the Roses,
and tradition has it that he died by the hand
of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, afterward
king. Weak in health, the possessor of a
mind which in boyhood showed the feverish
precocity that foreshadows an unbalanced
maturity, he was nevertheless generous, temperate,
mild, and devoted.</p>

<p>The early part of his reign gives one of the
few instances chronicled under the Lancastrian
kings of an attack upon constitutional
usages in taxation. In 1425 while the Duke
of Bedford and Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester
were acting virtually as regents to their nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the young king, Bedford together with various
other lords announced in Parliament that a
certain subsidy, which had been appropriated
for a particular purpose, should be levied for
the king’s use notwithstanding the conditions
attaching to it; they advanced an opinion of
the justices favoring their action. The commons
vindicated their right, however, in the
same Parliament; they made a fresh grant,
restating the former conditions, with this explicit
addition,<span class="sidenote">Declaration
for appropriation
of supplies</span> “No part thereof be beset ne
dispendid to no othir use, but oonly in and
for the defense of the seid roialme.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>It would be both wearisome and profitless
to enter into a detailed account of the various
subsidies on wool, of income taxes, of fifteenths
and tenths which trod one on the heels of the
other during the reign of Henry VI. One
incident of a constitutional character, however,
rises from the general regularity. In 1449,
Parliament attempted to levy a tax upon the
stipendiary priests, though usage had it that
the clergy were to have the power of taxing
themselves in convocation; a subsidy of a
noble was levied upon each stipendiary priest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>for which they were to receive a general pardon
at the hands of Parliament. Henry, perceiving
that trouble was brewing, addressed
the clergy, saying that it was for them to
make the grant in convocation, and that it
was for him to pardon. Thus Parliament, for
the moment overreaching itself, was forced
back upon the justice of precedent.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The wars with France and with Burgundy,
the heavy taxation incident to them, the rebellion
of Jack Cade arising out of it, and the
Wars of the Roses in 1453 following closely
thereafter; the woeful struggle of Henry,
bleached-out in mind, a dependent upon the
efforts of a woman <span class="sidenote">Accession
of the
Yorkists</span> against the rising power of
York; the wanton shedding of the noblest
blood in England&mdash;these neither developed
nor confirmed parliamentary power. Edward
of York, it is sufficient to understand, became
king on the 4th March, 1461, upon King
Henry’s overthrow. A momentary turning of
the tide set him once more upon it, but his
tenure was very brief and ended in tragedy.</p>

<p>The passing of Henry VI brings us to the
dawn of the Yorkist and Tudor era. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>the reigns of the son and grandson of Edward I
and the reigns of Richard II and the Lancastrians,
Parliament had developed swiftly,
not so much in the assumption of new powers
as in the distribution of powers within itself.
The commons became a separate body. Burgesses
learned to act in the House of Commons
in concert with knights of the shires who in
the time of Edward I had made common
cause with the greater barons. Together they
assumed the right of initiating taxes, with the
understanding that the hereditary chamber
should have solely the power of assent.</p>

<p>The right of Parliament as against that of
the king to control taxation was enunciated
again and again, not only in the instance of
direct taxation, including the levies of tallage,
but in the case of the customs, as indicated
in the legislation prohibiting the maletolt.</p>

<p>But the enunciation of powers of Parliament
was not followed by complete and undisputed
exercise of the rights so enunciated.
The kings clung to what they deemed their
ancient prerogatives and more than once overstepped
the law. The Yorkists and Tudors
showed a disposition somewhat less amenable.</p>

<p class="pch">EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY EXACTION<br />
1461-1603</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">With</span> the coming of the Yorkist kings in
1461 there began a period lasting until the
end of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, in which the
taxing powers of Parliament were subtly
assailed by monarchs who knew how to use
the law to their own advantage, regardless of
its intent. Yet the powers, attenuated though
they were, remained to form the substance
of vigorous opposition to the attacks of the
Stuarts, when they should try to practice their
theories of absolutism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward IV,
1461-1483</div>

<p>Under Edward IV, whose reign dates from
1461, the forms of taxation by authority of
Parliament were indeed gone through with.
In that respect his reign was typical of the
period. His early taxation, levied while the
struggle with the Lancastrians was still in
progress, was not particularly heavy; but being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
laid by Parliaments sympathetic with the
Yorkist cause, Edward had little difficulty
in exerting supreme influence over it. Four
years after his accession, he was given the
subsidy on wool and tunnage and poundage
for life.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Beside these, Parliament granted him
frequent fifteenths and tenths. Not content,
however, with the grants made by Parliament,
he had recourse to a new form of extortion
known by the euphemistic title of benevolence.
The benevolence was a gift made to
the king by individuals or groups of them,
ostensibly in charity, but in reality under enforcement.
It differed from the forced loan,
the exaction of which is mentioned in the list
of charges leading to the deposition of Richard
II, in that by it the king incurred no obligation
for repayment. Henry VIII in later
years proved himself a genius <span class="sidenote">Benevolences
and
forced
loans</span> at obtaining
both of these means of income. Edward
found also that the revival of obsolete statutes
and the laying of fines for breaches of them
could be turned to profit; the collection of ancient
debts due to the crown, and the utilization
of the royal power to advance his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>mercantile interests, Edward pushed to the
extreme in order to supplement the not infrequent
regular grants of Parliament.</p>

<p>Dowell retells the story given in Hall’s
<i>Chronicle</i> of Edward and a certain rich widow
to whom he applied in person for a benevolence.
In his younger days Edward was one
of the handsomest men in the land, and the
widow received his advances with favor. He
asked her for a gift and she promptly gave
him £20.</p>

<p>“By my troth,” says she, “for thy lovely
countenance thou shalt have even twenty
pounds.”</p>

<p>Edward, who had “looked for scarce half
that sum, thanked her and lovinglie kissed
her.” Thereupon the lady doubled the benevolence,
paying him a second £20, either,
as the Chronicler remarks, “because she esteemed
the kiss of a king so precious a jewele”
or “because the flavour of his breath did so
comfort her stomach.” Such was a fifteenth-century
conception of royal courtesy.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Upon Edward’s death in 1483, the crown
for a moment rested on the head of his young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>son, Edward V, only to be snatched away
<span class="sidenote">Richard III,
1483-1485</span> in favor of the lad’s uncle Richard III. Richard
received from Parliament in 1484 a grant
of tunnage and poundage and the subsidy on
wool for life.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> His death on Bosworth Field
the next year gave the world no opportunity
to see what use he would make of the freedom
which Parliament thus gave him.</p>

<p>During the brief three years of Richard’s
ascendancy, however, there occurred an assertion
of right and its complementary statute
which assume great importance in the light of
later events.<span class="sidenote">Prohibition
of benevolences,
1484</span> When Richard was invited to
become king, he was presented with a remarkable
address, which, among other things,
cited the benevolences of the late reign as
“extorcions, ... agenst the Lawes of God
and Man,” and as more intolerable than
“jopardye of deth.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> At his only Parliament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>held in 1484, benevolences were declared unlawful,
and were to be “dampned and annulled
forever.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Tudors</div>

<p>Henry VII, the first of the Tudors, ascended
the throne upon the successful issue of the
battle of Bosworth. The wonder of the era
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>which he introduced lies not in any increase
in the powers of Parliament, but rather that
they existed at all when the period closed.
The one hundred and twenty years of the
Tudor epoch exhibits no progress toward the
realization of parliamentary supremacy; on
the other hand, the trend was in the opposite
direction. The Tudors were not tyrannical
enough to rouse opposition to the fever heat
as did John; they knew rather how to bridle
their despotism in time to check revolt, and
especially how to make unlawful acts assume
the aspect of legality. Furthermore, the immense
activity of commerce, the progress of
literature, the religious reconstitution during
the sixteenth century, were in themselves reasons
for slow advance in matters of government;
the stress of trade consequent upon the
discovery of a new world, the absorbing interest
in new subjects for thought, the intensity
and magnitude of new religious conceptions,
engaged the minds of men on subjects
other than those of Parliament and king. As
long as these worked in apparent harmony
and the results did not greatly offend, men
were content to let well enough alone. So it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was that the Tudors, surrounding themselves
with a new nobility attached to the throne by
reasons of their very origin and continuance,
were able to follow their own devices and raise
money almost as seemed to them good.</p>

<p>In all the twenty-four years of Henry
VII’s reign he called Parliament only seven
times, and six of the seven Parliaments sat
within the first eleven years of his kingship.
Each was the occasion of a demand for money.
At his first Parliament, that of 1485, he received
a grant of tunnage and poundage and a subsidy
on wool for life.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Parliaments
of
Henry VII
The “new-found”
subsidy</span> Three years later, however,
the consequences of heavy taxation were disastrous.
Need arising for the enlistment of an
army with which to aid the Duke of Brittany
against the King of France, a tax was devised
which not only exacted a tenth of incomes
from freeholders, but applied as well to movables,
laying imposition upon articles used
in trade and even merchants’ stocks. This
“new-found subsidy” proved so intolerable
to the lower classes that a great insurrection
broke out in the north against it.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The king
with Tudor wisdom, remitted some £48,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>of the £75,000 which the tax was designed to
raise, and Parliament gave him in return a
fifteenth and tenth. In 1497, a similar rebellion
occurred in Cornwall against a tax
levied for the Scotch War.</p>

<p>With these examples of parliamentary taxation
before him, Henry turned away to
fields at once more profitable and less dangerous,
at least in their immediate consequences.</p>

<p>He turned to the old expedient of the benevolence,
despite the statute of Richard III
prohibiting its imposition. The methods used
in laying a benevolence are illustrated in the
famous account by Lord Francis Bacon of the
dilemma devised by Bishop Morton, Henry’s
Chancellor, “to raise up the benevolence to
a higher rate; and some called it his fork
and some his crotch.<span class="sidenote">Morton’s
crotch</span> For he had couched an
article in the instructions to the commissioners
who were to levy the benevolence, that if they
met with any that were sparing, they should
tell them that they must needs have, because
they laid up; and if they were spenders, they
must needs have, because it was seen in their
port and manner of living; so neither kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
came amiss.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Parliament, subservient to
the king, actually registered for the moment
its approval of the practice of levying benevolences,
when in 1492 it passed the “Shoring or
Under-propping Act” making debts still owing
on gifts promised to the king legally collectable.</p>

<p>The benevolence was not the only means
by which the ingenious monarch increased
his income. Like Edward IV, he revived
obsolete statutes and rigorously exacted fines
in consequence of every infraction of them;
but worse than that was his perversion of
every function of the courts of law into a
means of extortion. His odious instruments
in that work were Richard Empson and
Edmund Dudly who later were made to suffer
for the evil practices of the father in the reign
of the son. Beside these forms of imposition,
the king pushed to the extreme the exaction of
feudal dues accruing to the crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
VIII’s
early
taxation</div>

<p>Henry VIII succeeded to the crown in
1509. With his hand always on the pulse of
the nation, he knew when he could carry his
designs into execution and when he must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>wait for a fever to subside. His attitude toward
taxation was not characterized by the
same uniform regard for constitutional formalities
that distinguished his other acts, nor was
Parliament on the other hand quite as subservient
to his will as in matters farther from their
purses. His first Parliament showed its trust
in him by granting tunnage and poundage
for life, but with the distinct provision that
it be not taken into precedent. Beside this,
the Parliaments of 1513 and 1514 made generous
grants of a poll-tax, of a fifteenth and
tenth and of two subsidies of six pence in the
pound.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Despite the magnitude of the grant,
no opposition seems to have been provoked,
an unfailing sign of increasing wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal
Wolsey’s
breach of
privilege,
1523</div>

<p>At the Parliament of 1523, the first since
1515, Cardinal Wolsey committed a distinct
breach of Parliamentary privilege. Under
Henry IV it had been admitted by the king
that both houses of Parliament were to commune
apart, and that the king should have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>knowledge of the progress of a grant until the
two houses be of one accord.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Wolsey, as
representative of the royal power, reversed
the usual process. Going into the House of
Commons with all his following, “with his
maces, his pillars, his pole-axes, his cross,
his hatte, and the great seale too,”&mdash;in the
words of the speaker, Sir Thomas More,&mdash;he
asked for no less than £800,000 and required
that it be paid in four years; he suggested
that it “be raised out of the fifth part
of every man’s goods and lands.”</p>

<p>To the demand of the cardinal the commons
maintained perfect silence. The speaker
“with many probable arguments endeavoured
to shew the cardinal that his manner of coming
thither was neither expedient nor agreeable
to the ancient liberties of that House.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
Wolsey thereupon departed in a rage. The
next day the matter was argued by the commons
and the contention was made that
“though some men were well-monied, yet
in general it was known that the fifth of men’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>goods was not in plate or money, but in
stock and cattle. And that to pay away all
their coin would alter the whole frame and
intercourse of things.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> For fifteen days
the commons debated the question and at the
end of that time granted to the king a graduated
property tax, much smaller in amount
and covering four years in the payment. Wolsey’s
displeasure was very great and he made
a second journey to the commons in the hope
that he might induce them to be more generous.
He told them that he “desired to reason
with those who opposed his demands.”
He was answered that “it was the order of that
House to hear, and not to reason but amongst
themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Thus rebuffed, the cardinal
went away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s
commissions
and
benevolences</div>

<p>Henry did without Parliament for the next
seven years, but he was not deprived thereby
of money with which to carry on the business
of government. In 1526, commissions were
issued for the collection of a sixth from the
goods of the laity and a fourth from the
clergy.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> The people immediately evinced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>their knowledge of the law and complained
that the proceedings were illegal; the clergy
led the movement asserting that “the King
could take no man’s goods without the authority
of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The people began to
murmur and insurrection seemed imminent.
“If men should geue their goodes by a Commission,”
they said, “then wer it worse than
the taxes of Fraunce, and so England should
be bond and not free.”<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> In Suffolk rebellion
actually broke out; in London and in Kent
the people were in a ferment. Henry, being
what he was and knowing the nature of his
subjects, eased the tension by shoving the responsibility
of the measure on to the shoulders
of Wolsey,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and declared that he would receive
no money save as an “amiable graunte,”
which was collected in 1528, and was nothing
more agreeable than a benevolence. To this
the citizens of London raised objection on
the ground of the statute of Richard III. The
judges thereupon handed down an opinion
that that statute, being the work of an usurper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>was void. Thus did the courts evince their
subservience to the crown, and showed themselves
as open to royal influence as the tribunals
of the Stuarts a hundred years later.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
So in theory Henry’s attempt at arbitrary
taxation was frustrated; in practice, however,
the imposition, though its burden was transferred
from the turbulent lower classes to the
more amenable people of substance, merely
underwent a change of name. The exaction
was unparliamentary whether it was levied
as a king’s tax or under the thin guise of a
benevolence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forced
loans, 1522
and 1544</div>

<p>But Henry had other strings to his bow, and
of these the forced loan was one which served
him well. In 1522 commissioners were appointed
throughout the kingdom to ascertain
the value of every man’s possessions and to
require a certain part for the king, on the
understanding that they be repaid out of the
grants from the next Parliament. The promise
of repayment was under the king’s privy
seal.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> In 1544, forced loans were again exacted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>this time from all persons rated at £50
and more per annum. Parliament, subservient
to the king, far from protesting because
of these arbitrary demands upon the pockets
of the people, in two instances released the
king from liability to payment. In 1529,
Parliament “for themselves and all the whole
body of the realm which they represent,
freely, liberally, and absolutely, give and
grant unto the King’s highness ... all and
every sum and sums of money which to them
and every of them, is, ought, or might be due
by reason of any money ... advanced or
paid by way of trust or loan.”<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> This caused
much murmuring, but, as Hall’s Chronicle
rightly puts it, “Ther was no remedy.” In
1544 a similar act of a servile Parliament not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>only gives the king the funds borrowed under
the forced loan of 1542, but commands the
refunding of sums already paid by him to his
creditors in discharge of debts so incurred.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Profits of
the English
Reformation</div>

<p>The Reformation in England redounded
to the financial benefit of the Crown. In
1532 the clergy were relieved by act of
Parliament from the payment of annates
or first fruits, the sums which the ordaining
authorities exacted from those accorded
any preferment in the church, and which
amounted sometimes to as much as a year’s
income from the benefice. The exactions
were denounced as having risen by “an uncharitable
custom, grounded upon no just
or good title,” and through them “great and
inestimable sums of money have been daily
conveyed out of this realm, to the impoverishment
of the same, and to the advantage of
the court of Rome.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The same Parliament,
meeting for its fifth session on the 15th January,
1533-4, reënacted the statute without
the contingencies which had conditioned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>other.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Closely following came a statute
that deprived the Pope of his petty exactions
which for generations he had drawn
from the English Church. Thus were discontinued
peter-pence, procurations, fruits,
fees for dispensations, licenses, faculties and
grants.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The sixth session of this Parliament,
meeting at the end of the year 1534, turned
the procedure into comedy by attaching to
“the King’s imperial crown forever” the first-fruits
and tenths of the annual income of all
ecclesiastical benefices, the very payments
which it had declared to be in conformity
with an “uncharitable custom.”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
the
confirming
authority
in clerical
grants</div>

<p>Furthermore, at the session of 1533-4,
Parliament had laid very definite restrictions
upon the clergy in the matter of regular taxation.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
Since the early part of the fourteenth
century, indeed, almost since the beginning
of Parliament itself, the lesser clergy had
attended the sessions with great irregularity,
and had voted their taxes for the most part in
provincial assemblies. Now, however, came
the general prohibition that the clergy should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>not enact or execute ordinances binding upon
themselves without the king’s license and without
his approval when once they were made.
Included within the meaning of this prohibition
was the granting of taxes. From thenceforward
until the time of Charles II, when,
without any special enactment but by simple
process of evolution, the clergy began to be
taxed in the same manner and according to
the same rate as the laity, clerical grants
were submitted to Parliament for confirmation.</p>

<p>Henry VIII died in 1547. Notwithstanding
the heavy taxation, parliamentary and unparliamentary,
which had been exacted during
his reign, he remained popular with the great
majority of his subjects to his death. His
many vices were counterbalanced by his successful
wars, the heavy taxation by the growing
trade of England, and his semi-independence
of Parliament by most efficient administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth’s
accession,

<p>After the lapse of eleven years, which in so
far as they concern the evolution of the taxing
power of Parliament, composed in effect
an interregnum, Elizabeth succeeded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
throne of England. Elizabeth’s government
was a despotism and was illegal; but it was
so by sufferance, not because the nation was
ignorant of its true character or because the
people were unable to control it. When in
later years the attempt was made to create a
despotism against the voice of the people,
the result was a Cromwell and his Charles I.
Queen Elizabeth was loved by her subjects
and they put their trust in her. The sympathy
existing between queen and people could not
be illustrated better than by the following
anecdote, which suggests that under her rule
benevolences were really made with the good
will of the givers.</p>

<p>The queen, being at Coventry, is presented
by the mayor with a purse heavily filled with
gold.</p>

<p>“I have few such gifts, Mr. Mayor,” says
the queen; “it is a hundred pounds in gold!”</p>

<p>“Please, your grace,” the mayor answers,
“it is a great deal more we give you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asks the queen.</p>

<p>“It is,” the mayor replies, “the hearts of
your loving subjects.”</p>

<p>And the queen makes answer, “We thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
you, Mr. Mayor; it is a great deal more
indeed.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberality
of Elizabeth’s
Parliaments.
Her extra-Parliamentary
exactions</div>

<p>Subsidies were granted in Parliament with
liberality and readiness. Forced loans were
indeed exacted from the wealthy, but Elizabeth
took care to repay honorably and as
promptly as she could. A means of revenue
which relieved her from the frequent necessity
of applying to Parliament was the granting
of monopolies, based upon the right of the
crown to assure to an inventor or orginator
the exclusive benefits of his invention or
innovation. By 1601, however, the royal
power had encroached so far upon the rights
of the individual that the grants of monopoly
comprised exclusive control over many of the
necessaries of life. The list which was read in
the House of Commons in 1601, included:&mdash;currants,
iron, powder, cards, transportation
of leather, vinegar, sea-coal, lead, oil, starch,
glass, and even salt. The matter had been
first discussed in the Parliament of 1571, was
brought up again in 1597, and in 1601 Elizabeth
with the tact which she could summon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>on occasion, sent a message to the House to
allay if possible the agitation which was going
on there over the subject of monopolies. It
gave satisfaction. “Understanding that divers
patents” so ran the message, “which she had
granted had been grievous to her subjects,
some should be presently repealed, some
superseded, and none put in execution but
such as should first have a trial according to
the law for the good of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Thus
was this means of indirect taxation by the
crown done away with, until the time when
James I, putting his clumsy shoulder to the
wheel, should seek to introduce it again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commons

bills, 1593</div>

<p>Toward the close of the reign of Elizabeth
there was another evidence of the growing
realization on the part of the commons that
their powers were not to be tampered with.
In this instance, the vindication was not
against the prerogative of the sovereign, but
against an arrogation of power on the part of
the House of Lords. The incident was based
upon the decreasing liberality of the commons
in the years after the Armada. They had risen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>nobly to the defense of the nation against the
peril, but, with the passing of it, their generosity
had faded. In 1593, it was represented that,
though the queen had spent upon the war
some £1,030,000 of her own, the grants of the
commons persisted in being inadequate. A
message was sent down from the lords which
remarked upon the need for a supply and
requested the appointment of a committee of
conference. Sir Robert Cecil, reporting from
the committee, stated that the lords would
assent to no smaller grant than three entire
subsidies.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The commons, on the other hand,
had shown a disposition to grant no more than
two. Francis Bacon stated the issue. He
yielded to the subsidy, “but disliked,” he said,
“that this house should join with the upper
house in granting it. For the custom and
privilege of this house hath always been,
first to make offer of the subsidies from hence,
then to the upper house; except it were that
they present a bill unto this house, with desire
of our assent thereto, and then to send it up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>again.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The commons refused to have
further conference with the lords, so determined
were they to vindicate their right to
originate money bills, by the vote 217 to 128.
Notwithstanding this scrupulous adherence
to principle, they accepted the suggestion and
came forward with a grant of three subsidies,
six tenths and six fifteenths.</p>

<p>The death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603,
brought to an end the Tudor period and
cleared the throne for James Stuart. The
Tudor era was one which can be passed lightly
over in a strict account of progress toward
parliamentary supremacy in taxation. In such
a study the period of the Tudors is a bywater.
Yet the fact that the principles enunciated in
the years prior to their accession stayed alive
despite the attacks of Tudor subtlety, points
to a vitality sufficient to down the Stuarts, and
to establish permanent parliamentary control
over the laying of taxes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divine
right as
against
Parliamentary
supremacy</div>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> theory of divine right, by which the
Stuarts laid claim to a sovereignty as irresponsible
as it was far-reaching, in practice came
into direct conflict with another theory which
had been taking shape for some four centuries,
the supremacy of Parliament. In the field of
taxation the issue is scarcely less apparent.
Parliament asserted the supremacy of its
will over all kinds of taxes, indirect as well
as direct. The crown, on the other hand,
hesitating to close with the representatives of
the people over a question of their authority
in direct taxation, maintained that unchecked
royal power extended to indirect taxes, including
duties at the ports. Furthermore, the
crown, whenever occasion arose, sought to
elude the hold of Parliament upon direct
taxation, by resorting to the familiar resources
of benevolences and the sale of monopolies,
and at last to the levy of ship money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>With the issue so direct, the great question
was that of strength. Should the crown with
its array of adherents, upholding as their ideal
the perfect exercise of the royal prerogative,
prove itself stronger than the House of Commons?
Or were the commons to prevail, standing
for the principle that the representatives of
the people sitting in Parliament should have
complete control over the public purse?</p>

<div class="sidenote">James I,
1603-1625</div>

<p>James Stuart, swollen with intellectual pride,
was, according to the Duc de Sully, “the wisest
fool in Europe.” Worse than his vanity were
his unsteadiness and his insincerity, traceable,
perhaps, to the Italian-Gallic stock whence
he was bred.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Divine right, a doctrine by its
nature offensive to Englishmen, was in him
doubly hateful because he was not born king,
but was proclaimed by the Council, an act
ratified, however, by popular voice, and subsequently
acquiesced in by Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In the
matter of religion, he was not more agreeable;
suspected at times of plots to further Roman
Catholicism, he assumed toward the Puritans
especial animosity, they standing in his mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>not so much as preachers of religion as propagandists
of republicanism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James I
dictates
the composition
of

<p>He wasted no time in getting things started.
In the proclamation by which he summoned
his first Parliament, he assumed the power of
dictating what manner of men should compose
it, and directed that his Court of Chancery
should decide whether or not the certificates of
election fulfilled the royal conditions, “and
if any shall be found to be made contrarie to
this proclamation, the same is to be rejected
as unlawful and insufficient.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The commons,
however, shortly after their convening,
vindicated their privilege in the case of Goodwin
and Fortescue, and succeeded in maintaining
thereafter their right to decide upon
the legality of returns.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> In their “Apology
of the House of Commons, made to the king,
touching their Privileges,” nearly at the close
of this session, the commons complained
against the monopolies possessed by the great
trading companies in the face of many statutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>to the contrary, and the oppressive exercise
of the ancient prerogative of purveyance.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James

<p>In the department of regular taxation, however,
James at first adopted a conciliatory
attitude. On the 26th June, 1604, James
sent to the commons a letter “written with
his own hand but corrected as to the spelling,”
in which he expressed his pleasure as to a
subsidy.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> He stated his confidence in their
good-will, assuring them “in the word of a
King” that he would “be so far from taking
it unkindly, their not offering” to him a
subsidy, and that he would “only interpret
it to proceed from the care they have, that
our people should not have any occasion of
distaste.” James’s letter accomplished for
him what may well have been his purpose;
the commons immediately granted to him tunnage
and poundage for the space of his life.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>At the two subsequent sessions of 1605-6
and 1606-7 there was constant friction between
king and commons, yet there were no very
remarkable assertions of royal prerogative or
of parliamentary privilege. At the session of
1605, Parliament granted the king three entire
subsidies and six fifteenths, designed principally
to meet the royal indebtedness, some of
which held over since the time of Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
After the prorogation, James called no session
of Parliament until the 9th February, 1609-10.</p>

<p>But James could not meet his obligations
with the ordinary revenues of the crown. He
was spending between £500,000 and £600,000
a year, and his income was in the neighborhood
of £400,000; his annual deficit, therefore, was
not far from £150,000.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> James was obliged
to turn elsewhere, and the consequence of his
action was the famous Bate Case, the decision
in which was a step toward freeing the king
from parliamentary control over his revenues.</p>

<p>In 1603, in answer to the agitation against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the great monopolies, an Eastern trading <span class="sidenote">The Bate
Case</span> company,
known as the Levant Company, surrendered
its charter. This company, amongst
other privileges, had enjoyed the right of collecting
a duty on currants from other merchants
trading in them, and paid to the crown
in return for the franchise £4,000 a year.
When, therefore, the company yielded up its
charter, the crown was the loser by £4,000
annually. In order to make up for the loss,
the crown itself proceeded to lay a duty on currants.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
In 1605, the Levant Company again
received a charter, but James levied upon it,
nevertheless, his duty on currants, the rate being
five shillings on the hundred-weight over
and above that granted to him by Parliament
in its tunnage and poundage bill. It was a
merchant of the Levant Company, John Bate,
who raised the question of the legality of the
imposition. The case was taken to the Court
of Exchequer for decision. Had the barons
confined themselves to the strict laws of the
matter, there would not have been great ground
for objection to their decision. Precedent
drawn from the time of the Tudors and statutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>of the same period, were capable of being
brought forward in a fair adjudication of the
case, and would have substantiated the contention
of the crown, thus returning customs exactions,
nearly to the situation of 1300.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The fact
that the four barons decided the case unanimously
against John Bate could not, therefore,
be reasonably reprehended. But they permitted
themselves to slip off into philosophical
generalizations which struck the people as
absolutist in tenor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions
of the
Barons
in the
Bate Case</div>

<p>“It seemeth to me strange,” says Baron
Clarke in his opinion, “that any subjects
would contend with the King in this high
point of prerogative.... As it is not a kingdom
without subjects and government, so he
is not a king without revenues.... The
revenue of the Crown is the very essential part
of the Crown, and he who rendeth that from
the king pulleth also his crown from his head,
for it cannot be separated from the crown.”
He proceeded to advance the opinion that the
Statute of Edward III<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> which prohibited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>the crown the right of levying new impositions
on wool, woolfells, and leather, and which
provided that there be only imposed “the
custom and subsidy granted to the king,”
had no effect in the present instance, because
it extended to Edward III alone, “and shall
not bind his successors, for it is a principal
part of the Crown of England which the King
cannot diminish.”</p>

<p>The opinion of Chief Baron Fleming was
scarcely less sweeping. “The King’s power
is double,” he said, “ordinary and absolute....
That of the ordinary is for the profit of
particular subjects, for the execution of civil
justice ... in the ordinary courts, and nominated
... with us the common law; and these
laws cannot be changed without Parliament....
The absolute power of the king
is not that which is converted or executed to
private use, ... but is only that which is applied
to the general benefit of the people....
This power is not guided by the rules which
direct only at the common law, and is most
properly named policy and government....
The matter in question is material matter of
state, and ought to be ruled by the rules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
policy, and if it be so, the king hath done well
to execute his extraordinary power. All customs,
be they old or new, are no other but the
effects and issues of trades and commerce
with foreign nations; but all commerce and
affairs with foreigners ... are made by the
absolute power of the king; and he who hath
power of causes hath power also of effects.”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The position
of
Parliament</div>

<p>Parliament took its stand on the subject of
the impositions even before the decision was
published. In the Petition of Grievances
sent up by the commons at the end of the
session of 1606, a list which contained so
many complaints that James remarked that
“they had sent an oyes through the nation to
find them,” the plea was made that no such
duty could be demanded legally without the
consent of Parliament. The decision was
announced to them when they reassembled
in November 1606, but they took no action
and for a time the matter rested.</p>

<p>But it was James himself who, in his characteristic
tactless obstinacy, forced the issue.
On the 29th July, 1608, taking advantage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">The Book
of Rates
published
under
decision
in the
Bate Case,
1608</span> the Bate decision, he published under the
authority of the Great Seal his Book of Rates,
which laid heavy duties upon almost all articles
of merchandise, “to be forever hereafter
paid to the king and his successors on
pain of his displeasure.”<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The statement of
James’s own views on the subject could not
be more clearly put than he himself expressed
them in the commission for the levy of the impositions
addressed to the Earl of Salisbury,
Treasurer of England. “This special power
and prerogative,” he asserted, “(amongst many
others) hath both by men of understanding in
all ages and by the laws of all nations been
yielded and acknowledged to be proper and inherent
in the persons of princes, that they may
according to their several occasions raise to
themselves such fit and competent means by
levying of customs and impositions upon merchandise
transported out of their kingdom or
brought into their dominions ... as to their
wisdoms and discretions may seem convenient.”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Even with the money thus obtained, James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>was obliged at last after a lapse of nearly
two years and a half to turn to Parliament.
He summoned it for the 9th February 1609-10.
The commons, almost unanimously opposed to
the exercise of the royal prerogative in the
matter of the imposition, came prepared to
dispute the decision in the Bate Case. The
discussion, carried on in the face of a royal
prohibition, was managed by Hakewill, Yelverton,
and Whitelocke.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The upshot was
<span class="sidenote">Remonstrance
from the
Commons,
1609-10</span> a remonstrance in which the commons reminded
the king that “the policy and constitution
of this your kingdom appropriates unto
the kings of this realm, with the assent of the
Parliament, as well the sovereign power of
making laws as that of taxing or imposing
upon the subjects’ goods or merchandises
wherein they have justly such a property as
may not without their consent, be altered or
changed.” Further, they pointed to the
former occasions when the commons had complained
in Parliament of similar impositions,
and upon which redress was forthcoming. Reference
was made to the action of “famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
kings,” who “agreed that this old fundamental
right should be further declared and established
by act of Parliament, wherein it is
provided that no such charges should ever
be laid upon the people without their common
consent, as may appear by sundry records of
former times.” They went on to say, “We,
therefore, your Majesty’s most humble Commons
assembled in Parliament, following the
examples of this worthy case of our ancestors,
and out of a duty to those for whom we serve,
finding that your Majesty, without advice or
consent of Parliament, hath lately, in time of
peace, set both greater impositions, and far
more in number than any of your noble ancestors
did in time of war, have with all humility
presumed to present this most just and necessary
petition unto your Majesty: That all
impositions set without the assent of Parliament
may be quite abolished and taken away;
and that your Majesty, in imitation likewise
of your noble progenitors, will be pleased that
a law may be made during this session of
Parliament to declare that all impositions set
or to be set, upon your people, their goods and
merchandises, save only by common assent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in the Parliament, are and shall be void.”<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
The outcome was unsatisfactory. A bill
framed to prohibit further impositions than
those already in existence, was passed by the
House of Commons, but was cast out in the
upper chamber. The king was still able to
cover himself with the decision in the Bate
Case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cowel’s
“Interpreter”</div>

<p>The attitude of James toward a book
“lately published by one Doctor Cowel” and
esteemed to “contain certain matters of scandal
and offence toward the high court of
Parliament,”<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> all but brought him into active
conflict with the commons. This publication
called “The Interpreter” contained a defense
of the royal prerogative in such terms as greatly
to offend the power of Parliament. Doctor
Cowel had this to say under the head of
“Subsidy:”</p>

<p>“... A tax or tribute assessed by Parliament,
and granted by the Commons to be
levied of every subject according to the value
of his lands or goods, after the rate of 4<i>s.</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>the pound for land and 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for goods, as
it is not commonly used at this day. Some
hold opinion that this subsidy is granted by
the subject to the Prince, in recompense or
consideration, that whereas the Prince of his
absolute power might make laws of himself,
he doth of favor admit the consent of his subjects
therein, that all things in their own
confession may be done with the greater
indifferency.”<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>King James had been thoughtless enough
to let fall words of commendation for the book,
and his approval was followed by a request
from the commons for a conference with the
lords. James, however, wisely withdrew from
his position and issued a proclamation prohibiting
the further circulation of the work and
recalling the copies already issued. Thus did
the storm blow over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
“Great
Contract,”
1610</div>

<p>At this same session of Parliament, James,
through the Lord Treasurer, offered to accept
a composition for the incidents of feudal
tenure, including the right of purveyance.
By this so-called Great Contract, Parliament
was to provide for an annual payment to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>king of £200,000. But the idea, which at
first was distasteful to the commons, shortly
became equally out of favor with the king.
The amount of money required seemed excessive,
and the commons feared that it might
make the king independent of them. The
king, on the other hand, arrived ultimately
at the conclusion that by careful manipulation
he could readily increase his income to a sum
larger than that stated in the Great Contract.
Final consideration was put over to the session
of Parliament called for the 16th October following.
At the last moment, however, when
an agreement seemed by no means hopeless,
a religious misunderstanding intervened, and
the negotiations fell through.</p>

<p>The matter of a subsidy was treated with
somewhat greater favor, though with small
generosity. Parliament granted the king one
entire subsidy and one fifteenth and tenth.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
Parliament was dissolved 9th February, 1611,
and for three years James tried to carry on
his government without it.</p>

<p>James’s attempt at absolutism was not a
financial success; a court which was as extravagant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>as it was dissolute helped him increase
his deficit; he ran behind about £200,000 a
year, notwithstanding the fact that he set in
motion all the machinery of <span class="sidenote">Petty
extortion
after the
dissolution
of Parliament</span> petty extortion
that he dared. He tried to force loans on the
security of his privy seal but frequently met
with refusal from which there was no appeal.
The jurisdiction of the Star Chamber was
used as a means to lay fines which were
usually unjust and always excessive. He sold
peerages and raised money on the crown
lands, and induced the French king and the
Dutch to pay up old debts owing to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James’s
second

as the
“Addled

<p>His enormous annual deficit forced him in
1614 to summon his second Parliament. It
came with a great and active majority lined
up against the king. It speedily passed by
a unanimous vote a resolution against the
king’s right of imposing taxes without the
consent of Parliament, and demanded a conference
on that subject with the House of
Lords;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> the lords, however, turned to the

on the legal points involved, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>judges, by the words of Chief Justice Coke,
refused to render an extra-judicial opinion.
The conference was then refused. The king,
becoming impatient at the delay of the commons
in accomplishing the purpose for which
he had summoned them to Parliament, with
his usual failure to adapt himself to circumstances,
sent a message to the House threatening
a dissolution of Parliament unless procedure
were immediately taken in the direction
of granting supplies.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The commons met the
issue squarely; they said that they were determined
to conclude the matter of the impositions
before granting a supply. On the 7th
of June, two months and two days after the
date upon which it had been convened, James
redeemed his word and dissolved Parliament.
It had not passed a single bill and thus earned
the title by which it is known to history,&mdash;the
“Addled” Parliament. But it had succeeded
in maintaining its principle of making supply
wait upon redress of grievances, and some of
its members had shot barbed shafts at the
king, wherefore James locked up those who
had aimed most surely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>With the hope gone of securing a grant,
James had to return to his old courses of
obtaining income. Forced loans, monopolies,
heavy fines, feudal payments rigorously exacted,
and the systematic extortion of <span class="sidenote">Resort to
extortion</span> benevolences,
figured in his programme. The
Council sent out orders to all the sheriffs and
magistrates to send in contributions from all
men of ability to pay; to those who refused,
suggestions were made of impending evil. The
judges of assize were especially urged to recommend
payments. The benevolences netted
less than £43,000 for the three years during
which they were made.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>But the nation did not submit tamely.
Several counties sent up protests against the
demand, recalling in defense of their position
the Statute of Richard III which forbade the
levying of “exactions, called benevolences.”
<span class="sidenote">Case of
Oliver
St. John</span> The refusal of Oliver St. John to the request
for a benevolence by the mayor of Marlborough,
brought him into immediate conflict
with the king. His written reply to the mayor
maintained the illegality of the demand on
the ground that it was contrary to Magna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Carta and to the Statute of Richard III. He
further charged the king with breaking his
coronation oath, and declared that all who
paid the benevolence were incriminated with
him. He was haled before the Star Chamber
and sentenced by it to pay a fine of £5,000
and to imprisonment during the king’s pleasure.
Thus it was that James tried to rule
without a Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James’s
third Parliament,
1620-21</div>

<p>But the rule could not long continue. James
summoned his third Parliament for the 30th
January, 1620-21. He addressed both Houses
in a conciliatory manner, hopefully and with
many promises. “For you to hunt after grievances,”
he said, “to the prejudice of your
king and yourselves, is not the errand: deal
with me as I deserve at your hands; I will
leave nothing undone that becomes a just
king, if you deal with me accordingly.”<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The
commons were in a good temper and a reconciliation
seemed far more likely to eventuate
than a struggle.</p>

<p>As for the royal advice about grievances,
the commons were slow to take it. When,
shortly after the beginning of the session, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>was moved that the House proceed to the
consideration of a supply, it was stated that
supply and redress of grievances <span class="sidenote">Supply
waits upon
redress of
grievances</span> should go
“hand in hand together,” that they were “as
twins; to go together and have no precedency.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
It was resolved that the business
of the supply be not decided independently
of a consideration of grievances and of a petition
to the king for freedom of speech, thus
recalling the imprisonment of members in 1614
at the time of the dissolution of the Addled
Parliament.</p>

<p>High in the list of grievances was the granting
of monopolies. Patents of monopoly
subserved a number of diverse purposes,
some of which were entirely legitimate. Objection
could not be made to restrictions in
the sale of certain commodities such as liquors
and explosives, nor to the assurance given to
an inventor that he had an exclusive right to
profits accruing from his invention. But
James was free with his grants of monopoly
for the enrichment of his courtiers and himself.
Parliament laid by the heels the monopolists
who had most abused their privileges, and

<p>Before the judgment was given, however,
but not before it was clearly discernible what
was to be the trend of events, the commons
set themselves to the consideration of a supply
bill and on the 18th March passed it unanimously.
It provided for two entire subsidies.
“In the midst of their inquiries into public
grievances,<span class="sidenote">Granting

consider the necessities of the State and grant
the king a supply.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The major part of the session was spent in
reforming abuses, both by impeaching the
officials responsible for them, and by framing
legislation for their correction. Chief amongst
those who fell under condemnation at the bar
of the House of Lords was Lord Francis
Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England, convicted
of bribery. King James in the early part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>the session seemed not out of sympathy with
these efforts to reform the administration,
but as time wore on and the commons still
busied themselves with investigations of official
misconduct, he wearied, and on the 28th
May, the Lord Treasurer declared to the
lords the king’s determination to adjourn Parliament.
Two of the five reasons assigned for
the adjournment were these: “For that the
profits of his Majesty’s revenues are, as it
were, at a stand;” and “The omission of the
State.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> A week later, after great complaint by
the commons, the session was adjourned to reassemble
on the 14th November. Throughout
the four months during which it had sat, no
complaint had been registered against the impositions
at the outports. Apparently the commons
were willing for the moment <span class="sidenote">James in
a temper
adjourns
Parliament</span> to let them
rest, or else, as is more likely, were quite unmindful
of them.</p>

<p>Parliament met on the 20th November for
its final session. Lord Treasurer Cranfield
reported that the exchequer was depleted, that
the two subsidies which had been granted the
previous March had been spent in furthering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>the interests of James’s son-in-law, Frederic,
Elector Palatine, and “that the business now
in hand required a great and speedy supply.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
It was understood that the cost of maintaining
an army in the Palatinate would be not far
from £900,000 a year.<span class="sidenote">Dilatory
action on
a subsidy</span> The Lord Treasurer
wished “that the Commons would so handle
this business as to make his Majesty in love
with the Parliaments.”</p>

<p>But they took some time to consider it. At
the end of the first week, the commons resolved
in committee of the whole house upon
a single subsidy, which, since it was to be
levied doubly upon papists, would provide
some £100,000 for the prosecution of war in
the Palatine.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> That was as near an actual
grant as the commons came during the session.
On the 1st December, they fell into a conflict
with the king over matters of privilege, which
had its rise in the imprisonment of Sir Edwin
Sandys during the last recess of Parliament,
presumably for utterances made in the House.
There were petitions to James and replies
from him, culminating in a remarkable Protestation
asserting the right of free speech in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
House.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> On the day of the presentation of
this Protestation, the 18th December, James
adjourned Parliament to the 8th February;
he then sent for the Journal of the House of
Commons and tore from it the objectionable
entry with his own hand. In the stress of
these events, the proposed subsidy was allowed
to slip out of mind; only did the lords propose
a meeting with the commons to consider a
supply, and this came to naught. On the
6th January, 1621-22, James saw fit not to
await the reassembling of Parliament, but
issued a proclamation of dissolution in which
he denounced those who had questioned his
prerogatives in the House of Commons as
“ill-tempered spirits.” Then he committed
to prison such of them as he regarded as being
most hostile, amongst whom were Sir Edward
Coke, Pym, Selden, and Mallory.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James’s
last Parliament,
1623-24</div>

<p>James convened his last Parliament on the
19th February, 1623-24. In the interval which
had elapsed since the dissolution, James recovered
his conciliatory attitude toward the
commons. The plan of marrying the Prince
of Wales, the young Prince Charles, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Infanta of Spain, had been given up, and thus
Englishmen were relieved of what to them had
been a pro-popish plot, and had been deprecated
again and again as the odious Spanish
Match. The programme with respect to the
Palatinate favored by the king was that favored
by the commons, and the reign of James
seemed to be approaching a happy conclusion.
<span class="sidenote">Supply

three subsidies and three fifteenths and tenths,
providing a somewhat greater sum than
£300,000.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The money was voted on the
condition that, in order to insure its application
to the naval and military establishments,
it be paid into the hands of commissioners
appointed by the commons, and be expended
by them upon direction of the council of war.
The sympathy existing between king and
Parliament was further exhibited in the successful
passage of an act forbidding monopolies
in the sale of any merchandise or in practicing
any trade, the only legislative act of
constructive importance in his reign.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Parliament

James I,
27th
March,
1625</div>

<p>Less than a year later King James died.
Apparently at the end of his reign he was
learning wisdom for he was beginning to understand
Parliament. He left his crown to the
keeping of a son who had in no wise profited
by the father’s experience. Charles I, brought
up in an atmosphere of divine right, was predisposed
to pursue that theory to the end. But
worse than that, in arguing his melancholy
destiny, was his faithlessness. An odious policy
executed without respect for truth brought him
at last to death outside his palace of Whitehall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Parliament
of
Charles</div>

<p>The first Parliament of Charles I recalls
vividly the mid-reign experiences of James.
It convened on the 18th June, 1625, and was
met with a request for a large and unconditional
grant with which to prosecute the war
which Charles had inherited from his father.
The commons, however, were careful; they
looked rather for a solid establishment of
government at home than for a war abroad.
Breaking the habit of two centuries, they
offered Charles tunnage and poundage for a
year instead of the term of his life, a measure
which, because of lack of precedent, was
rejected in the House of Lords; and granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
only two subsidies.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> On the 10th August,
the chancellor delivered a message to the commons
from the king. He desired “a present
answer about his supply: If not, he will
take care of their healths <span class="sidenote">Worry
about the
supply</span> more than they
themselves, and make as good a shift for his
present occasions as he could.”<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The House
spent the rest of the day debating the matter,
and on the next proceeded in the consideration
of grievances, postponing the supply.
Delay the king would not brook; perceiving
that the commons were bent upon a redress
of grievances before the granting of further
aid, and because in the debates they had presumed
“to reflect upon some great persons
near himself,” on the 12th August he dissolved
Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and looked to his privy seal as
a means of revenue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His second
Parliament.
Buckingham</div>

<p>Six months later, on the 6th February,
1625-26, Charles opened his second Parliament
and met with no better success. The
commons did not consider immediately the
question of a supply, but to the immense irritation
of the king, proceeded to inquire into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>the conduct of the Duke of Buckingham, the
favorite of Charles. He sent a message to the
commons saying that he would “not allow
any of his servants to be questioned amongst
them, much less such as are of eminent place
and near unto him.” But the chief significance
of his message was in its conclusion.
“I wish you would hasten my supply,” so it
ran, “or else it will be worse for yourselves;
for if any ill happen, I think I shall be the last
that shall feel it.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
The commons replied
with a grant of three subsidies and three
fifteenths, but the conditions were such as to
make it <span class="sidenote">A grant
with hard
conditions</span> almost worse for Charles than no
grant at all. The bill was not to be brought
in until the king should have given answer to
their list of grievances, and among the grievances
the Duke of Buckingham was chief.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
Later a fourth subsidy was added and a movement
was put on foot to give Charles tunnage
and poundage for life; but in the bill it was
specified that a remonstrance should be drawn
up against his taking those duties without the
previous consent of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>commons went on with their formal impeachment
of Buckingham. But before the matter
was settled, and consequently before the
Commons had made final grants of the
promised subsidies, Charles, in the hope of
relieving the desperate plight of his favorite,
dissolved Parliament, on the 15th June.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forced
loans at
the rating
of a
subsidy</div>

<p>The dissolution left Charles without the
means with which to carry on the proposed
war with Spain. He turned again to old
expedients; he forced loans, exacted benevolences,
and suspended penal laws for a consideration.
The loans took the form of a
general levy according to the well-known rate
of the subsidy and were thus in effect assessments
of a general tax by the arbitrary power
of the crown. Of great importance in the
light of subsequent history, was the requisition
made upon the seaport towns for ships
armed and equipped, the precursor of the
demand for ship money. Imprisonment, impressment
into the royal navy, the quartering
of soldiers upon the inhabitants, the dismissal
from offices held of the crown, were the several
rewards of those sufficiently courageous to
stand by the principle that taxes be laid only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
by the assent of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> By an order in
Council it was declared, “that all customs,
duties, and imposts on all goods and merchandizes
exported and imported, which, for many
ages had been continued, and esteemed a
principal and necessary part of the revenue of
the crown, should be levied and paid.” The
hope was expressed that these levies “might
receive an absolute settlement by Parliament,”
when that body should again assemble.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Not being content with the financial difficulties
incident to the war with Spain, Charles,
at the suggestion of Buckingham, slipped into
a war with France. Buckingham led an
expedition to the Isle of Rhé, met with disaster
and ignominy, and succeeded in using
up the ready money of the king. Charles
<span class="sidenote">Charles’s
third Parliament, 1627-28</span> had
to call his third Parliament in order to obtain
supplies. It met 17th March, 1627-28. The
king attempted to propitiate the commons by
releasing the prisoners whom he still held for
refusing to meet the demand for the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>loan. In his opening speech, Charles took
the wrong tack. “There is none here,” he
said, “but knows that common danger is the
cause of this Parliament, and that supply at
this time is the chief end of it.... If you,
(which God forbid) should not do your duties
in contributing what the State at this time
needs, I must in discharge of my conscience,
use those other means which God hath put
into my hands, to save that which the follies
of some particular men may otherwise hazard
to lose.”<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Nor was this bold assertion of
the divine right of a king to put his hand in
the pockets of his subjects enough. The
lord keeper said in addition, <span class="sidenote">Threats of
non- Parliamentary
exaction</span>“This way (of
obtaining a supply), as his Majesty hath told
you, he hath chosen, not as the only way, but
as the fittest; not as destitute of others, but
as most agreeable to the goodness of his own
most gracious disposition, and to the desire
and weal of his people. If this be deferred,
necessity and the sword of the enemy will
make way to others. Remember his Majesty’s
admonition: I say, remember it.”<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>The House immediately set itself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
consideration of grievances,<span class="sidenote">Grievances
have precedence</span> chief amongst
which were “raising money by loans, by
benevolences, and privy seals: and what was
too fresh in memory, the imprisonment of
certain gentlemen who refused to lend.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
The matter of a supply was debated, but
passed by in favor of the grievances. On the
3rd April, the commons agreed unanimously
to certain highly significant resolutions against
the powers assumed by the king. “No freeman
ought to be committed, or detained in
prison, or otherwise restrained,” they said, “by
command of the king, or the Privy Council, or
any other,” except for lawful cause expressed
in a lawful warrant; and “that the ancient and
undoubted right of every freeman is, that he
hath a full and absolute property in his goods
and estate;<span class="sidenote">Denunciation
of
extortions</span> and that no tax, tallage, loan,
benevolence, or other like charge, ought to
be commanded or levied by the king or his
ministers, without common assent of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>For the space of two months the commons
and the House of Lords engaged themselves
in conference and separately in the consideration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>of a petition defining, the rights asserted
in the resolutions. On the part of the
commons the chief advocates were Selden,
Littleton, and Digges; Sir Edward Coke, whose
unwillingness to bend the judicial knee to King
James had procured his dismissal long since
from the chief-justiceship; and Noy, the genius
who was shortly to turn against the Commons
and in his invention of ship money furnish a
means whereby to lay taxes without parliamentary
assent. The interest of the crown was defended
by attorney-general Heath and Sergent
Ashley. The king was in a dilemma; he could
not permit the petition to be brought in, in
parliamentary form, and he could not dissolve
Parliament without losing five subsidies which
the commons had signified their willingness to
grant him.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> He therefore tried to steer a
middle course; he offered to Parliament his
royal word not to imprison unjustly and expressed
his willingness to confirm the charters.
Coke, however, insisted upon a specific statement
of issues; any such hazy settlement of difficulties
as the king proposed was unlikely to
be permanent; definiteness was essential. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>that end he proposed the drawing up of a
Petition of Right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Petition
of Right</div>

<p>When the instrument was at last drawn up,
it was sent to the House of Lords. The lords
attempted to introduce an amendment designed
“to leave entire that sovereign power,”
as the proposed change itself ran, “wherewith
your Majesty is trusted for the protection,
safety and happiness of your people;”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> but the
commons would have none of it, and at last the
lords yielded their assent. The king at first
gave a cumbersome, evasive answer to the petition
which was in reality no answer at all,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
and roused thereby a storm of indignation,
which exhibited itself in a movement to censure
Buckingham. This the king averted by signing
the Petition of Right in the usual manner,
and received in consequence his five subsidies.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>The Petition which thus became a regularly
passed Act of Parliament, is of transcendent
importance in the development of the control
of the people over the public purse. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
terms absolutely unequivocal,<span class="sidenote">The statutes

charge, not set by common consent in Parliament.”
The statutory sources whence that
freedom was inherited are cited in detail. The
citations, are, however, ill-taken. <i>Statutum
de tallagio non concedendo</i> was in all likelihood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
no statute at all, but a chronicler’s
abstract of Edward I’s Confirmatio Cartarum,
or perhaps an unauthoritative copy of the pardon
which was granted to Humfrey Bohun
and Roger Bigod at approximately the same
time with the Confirmation of the Charters.
It is not unlikely that the citation of the statute
of the 25th of Edward III was an error;
at any rate, the text of the statute has not been
discovered,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> and the date at which it was said
to be enacted was at the height of the great
plague, a time scarcely adapted to the assertion
of a great constitutional principle. But
the precise historical foundation upon which
Sir Edward Coke and his associates based
their charges against the king, is of quite secondary
importance. The true value of the
Petition of Right lies in this, that Charles I
had been obliged to subscribe to a statutory
provision by which no man thereafter was to
“be compelled to make or yield any gift, loan,
benevolence, tax, or such like charge, without
common consent by Act of Parliament.”
That was indeed supremely important.</p>

<p>But the language of the Petition of Right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>might reasonably be taken to refer only to
internal taxes and that the matter of customs
duties, the charges upon merchandise at the
outports, was left still in the air. Protests
had indeed been made against the exaction
of these duties by the crown, especially during
the reign of James <span class="sidenote">The
Petition of
Right and
customs
duties</span> in the great agitation over
the Book of Rates, but no statute had been
passed providing definitely for parliamentary
control. To that end, the commons delayed
the passage of a bill which gave the king tunnage
and poundage for life, pending the acceptance
by him of a remonstrance against impositions.
The remonstrance as framed by the
commons declared that “there ought not any
imposition to be laid upon the goods of merchants,
exported or imported, <i>without the
common consent by Act of Parliament</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> It
further made assertion that the laying of
impositions at the outports was contrary to
the Petition of Right. The king’s attitude
was decisive; before the remonstrance was
handed to him, he evaded the issue by proroguing
Parliament. Never, so he said, would
he give away tunnage and poundage; he must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>needs retain them for himself. The session
ended 26th June, 1628.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>During the six months which elapsed before
the reassembling of Parliament, Charles continued
to <span class="sidenote">Tunnage
and
poundage</span> levy tunnage and poundage upon his
own authority, relying still upon the decision
in the Bate Case for his justification. Several
merchants who refused to pay were promptly
clapped into prison; among those whose
goods were seized for the same reason was
Henry Rolles, a member of the House of
Commons. The second session of Parliament
was called for the 20th January, 1628-29; the
commons came together with no pretense of
smothering their indignation against the conduct
of the king. A number of plans were
brought forward as means of rectifying the
abuses. The evident determination of the
commons to conclude the matter, daunted the
king. Summoning both Houses to Whitehall,
he renounced the right of levying tunnage
and poundage. “It ever was, and still is my
meaning,” so were his words, “by the gift
of my people to enjoy it, and my intention
in my speech at the end of the last session was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>not to challenge tunnage and poundage as of
right, but <i>de bene esse</i>, showing you the necessity,
not the right, by which I was to take it
until you had granted it to me, assuring myself
according to your general professions
that you wanted time and not good-will to
give it me.”<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> For a moment it appeared as
though this abandonment of position by the
king would end the conflict. Three days after
his reception of the Houses at Whitehall, Mr.
Secretary Cooke moved the reading of a bill
granting him tunnage and poundage for life.
But it never passed. The commons were
distracted by a question of religious innovation,
talked at great length over their religious
grievances, and allowed their momentary
flush of cordial feeling toward the king to cool.
Mr. Secretary Cooke on the two days following
that upon which he made his motion regarding
tunnage and poundage, delivered messages
from Charles urging haste in the consideration
of the measure.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> On the 2nd February,
the commons acknowledged the receipt of
the messages, but rather than pass a bill
satisfactory to the king in this particular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>they stated their intent to “proceed with religion.”<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th February they began a lengthy
consideration of the breach of privilege committed
against the House of Commons in the
seizure of the goods of Henry Rolles, the merchant
member of the House, who had refused
payment of tunnage and poundage during
the recent recess. The officers who had participated
in the seizure of his goods were summoned
before the commons that they might
answer for contempt. The stand was taken
against the king on this ground of privilege,
instead, as Pym advised, of objecting on the
broad constitutional ground that Parliament
had not granted the tax. This hostility was
too much for the conciliatory spirit which
Charles had evinced at the opening of the session.
Through Mr. Secretary Cooke, he announced
his unwillingness to have his officers
questioned, since “what they did was by his
own direct command, or by order of the council-board,
his Majesty himself being present, and
therefore, would not have it divided from his
act.”<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The question was fought out on the 2nd
March, when the commons reassembled after
a brief recess. The king, hoping to arrange
the difficulty privately with the leaders of the
House, ordered the recess to be continued
until the 10th March. To this the commons
entered vigorous protest; at the putting of the
question, the vote was overwhelmingly against
adjournment.<span class="sidenote">Tumult
in the
Commons</span> The speaker, Sir John Finch,
in obedience to the royal will, attempted to
leave his chair, and thus break up the session;
but Holles and Valentine, two members most
eager for the consideration of the matters pressing
for attention, pushed him back into his seat.
Sir John Eliot, who had drawn up three resolutions
expressing the mind of the commons
on the questions of religion and taxation, read
them above the uproar. The speaker and the
clerk refused to put the vote and the king’s
guard was already on its way to make a forcible
end to the proceedings. At the moment
when the guardsmen were at the door, Holles
read the resolutions and they were carried by
acclamation. The House then adjourned in
a tumult until the 10th March.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<p>The resolutions were most explicit. The
two which concerned the impositions said:
“Whosoever shall counsel or advise the taking
and levying of the subsidies of tunnage and
poundage, not being granted by Parliament,
or shall be an actor and instrument therein,
shall be likewise reputed an innovator in the
government and a capital enemy to this kingdom
and commonwealth.” And: “If any merchant
or other person whatsoever shall voluntarily
yield or pay the said subsidies of
tunnage and poundage not being granted by
Parliament, he shall likewise be reputed a betrayer
of the liberty of England, and an enemy
to the same.”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>When the House reconvened on the 10th
March, the king dissolved Parliament without
further ado. With respect to such of the
commons as merited his displeasure he remarked
that the vipers amongst them would
meet with their rewards.</p>

<p>With the dissolution of his third Parliament,
Charles entered upon a new epoch in his
reign; and at the conclusion of it, he found
that his game had been for too heavy stakes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and that he had lost.<span class="sidenote">Charles’s
eleven
years
without
Parliament,
1629-40</span> For eleven years he did
without a Parliament. He began by issuing
a Declaration addressed to his “loving subjects”
in which he told the history of the late
session from his own point of view,&mdash;that
he was in extreme need of money with which
to meet the necessities of England and relieve
the “miserable afflicted state” of Protestants
abroad, that Parliament had proved itself
intractable, and had greatly delayed, contrary
to all precedent, in the matter of tunnage and
poundage; not only that, but upon his graciously
yielding to Parliament the power of
granting him tunnage and poundage, it had
raised up still another cause for delay in the
case of Henry Holles.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> In a proclamation
issued two weeks later he plainly exhibited
his intention to rule without a Parliament;
“the calling, continuing, and dissolving of
them,” he said, “being always in the King’s
own power. And his Majesty shall be more
inclinable to meet in Parliament again when
his people shall see more clearly into his
intents and actions, when such as have bred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>this interruption shall receive their condign
punishment.”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>He imprisoned accordingly Holles, Strode,
Sir John Eliot and others whom he included
amongst the vipers of the commons, and removed
such of them to the Tower as were
able to sue out their writs of habeas corpus,
in order that he might thus elude the service
of the writs. But imprisonment was scarcely
a means of relief to the king’s financial exigencies.
<span class="sidenote">His
financial
expedients</span> He turned to expedients which were
exceedingly oppressive, and most of them
clearly illegal. He rigorously extorted tunnage
and poundage by the arbitrary authority of
the crown; he reëstablished the monopolies
abolished under James I, and applied them
to nearly every article in common use; he
revived laws long since dead and applied them
stringently for the sake of their fines; he
revived forest legislation and increased the
limits of the royal woodlands, mulcting the
owners of adjoining property for encroachment;
he searched titles of estates for defects
which would make them liable to reversion
to the crown; he went back to the old practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>of compulsory knighthood for those who had
£40 or more in lands or rents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ship
money,
first writ,
20th October,
1634</div>

<p>But the supreme grievance was the extortion
of ship money. Sir William Noy, lately
leader in the commons in defense of popular
power against royal prerogative, now become
by the grace of the king attorney-general and a
chief supporter of that same royal prerogative,
shut himself up in the Tower for some days
that he might better consult the ancient authorities.
“Shaking off the dust of ages from
parchments in the Tower,” says Hallam,
“this man of venal diligence and prostituted
learning discovered that the seaports and even
maritime counties had in early times been
sometimes called upon to furnish ships for
the public service; nay there were instances
for a similar demand upon some inland
places.”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> The first writ of ship money was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>directed to the magistrates of London and
other seaport towns, and was issued on the
20th October, 1634. It recited the depredations
of pirates, “Turks, enemies of the
Christian name,” and the prevalence of war
upon the continent. It enjoined upon the
magistrates the furnishing of ships of specific
tonnage and equipage by the 1st of the following
March. They were empowered to assess
all the inhabitants according to their substance,
both for the fitting out of the ships and the
maintenance of their crews for the space of
six months. Refusals to pay were punishable
by imprisonment. The writ was issued by
the king with the advice of the Privy Council.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>The show of precedent was barely an
extenuation, not a justification of the demand.
As a matter of fact, it was virtually an extortion
of a tax, and as such was a distinct violation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>of the Petition of Right. London, being
the only port in the kingdom capable of constructing
and equipping ships of the character
designated in the writs, was the only town able
to make literal compliance with the demand.
The rest were obliged to make money payments.
But the matter was to come up later
in the courts, and the legality or <span class="sidenote">The true
occasion
for the levy</span> illegality of
the writs was there to be decided. As for the
occasion of the requisition denominated in the
ordinance, that was false. The design was
not against “Turks, enemies of the Christian
name,” but against the Dutch Republic.
Charles had proposed a secret treaty with
Spain whereby the government of the Lowlanders
should be overthrown and its territory
be divided between England and Spain.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
Not only was this act of Charles a breach of
his recent great compact with the nation, but
it had for its purpose an act of aggression
against the people who stood for the highest
political ideals then known in Europe, and
was based on a lie.</p>

<p>Sir John Finch, the chief justice of common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>pleas, the same who, as speaker of the
commons, had been forcibly held in his chair
in order to keep the House in session at the
close of the last Parliament, undertook the
levying of ship money upon the death of Noy;
he advanced the fortunes of the writs by making
them applicable to the entire kingdom.<span class="sidenote">Second
writ, 4th
August,
1635.
Its general
application</span> On
the 4th August, 1635, the demand made its
second appearance; it was to cover not only
the needs of a navy, but to furnish “a spring
and magazine that should have no bottom,
and for an everlasting supply for all occasions.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
Instructions were included in the
writs to the sheriffs, by which the ships could
be compounded for by the counties, and the
amount transmitted to the treasurer of the
navy for his Majesty’s uses. Payment was to
be enforced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third writ,
9th October,
1636</div>

<p>A year later, the 9th October, 1636, the
third assessment was laid. Murmuring against
the writs, which was common enough amongst
the lower classes in 1635, now spread to men
of great position. The earls of Danby and
Warwick and other peers protested to the
king, not so much against the amount of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>tax, as against the unconstitutional manner of
its levy. But Charles found it too profitable
a means of income to let go; he was the richer
each year by some £200,000.</p>

<p>The courts, however, seemed of contrary
mind to the rest of the nation. In November,
1635, at the instance of Sir John Finch, the
following extra-judicial opinion was delivered
<span class="sidenote">Extra-judicial
opinions</span>
by the judges:&mdash;“I am of the opinion that,
as when the benefit doth more particularly
redound to the ports or maritime parts, as in
case of piracy or depredations upon the seas,
that the charge hath been, and may be lawfully
imposed upon them according to precedents
of former times; so when the good and
safety of the kingdom in general is concerned,
and the whole kingdom in danger (of which his
Majesty is the only judge), then the charge
of the defence ought to be borne by all the
realm in general. This I hold agreeably both
to law and reason.”<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>On the 7th February, 1637, Charles laid
the case before the judges of the Exchequer
extra-judicially in much the same terms as
the opinion of 1635. He requested an answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>to the following question:&mdash;“When the good
and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned,
and the whole Kingdom in danger,
whether may not the King, by writ under the
Great Seal of England, command all the
subjects of our Kingdom at their charge to
provide and furnish such a number of ships,
with men, victuals, and munition, and for
such time as we shall think fit for the defence
and safeguard of the kingdom from such
danger and peril, and by law compel the
doing thereof, in case of refusal or refractoriness:
and whether in such a case is not the
King the sole judge both of the danger, and
when and how the same is to be prevented
and avoided?”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The opinion of the judges
was ostensibly unanimous in favor of the
crown; Coke and Hutton as a matter of fact
dissented, but subscribed on the principle
that the opinion of the majority should be
that of the whole body.</p>

<p>In the face of this sweeping and conclusive
opinion delivered privately to the king, there
was apparently no hope for any one who
should have to answer in that court for refusal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Hampden’s
Case, 1637</span> Shortly thereafter, however, such a case came
up. John Hampden, a gentleman of Buckinghamshire,
had refused to pay the assessment
of 20<i>s.</i> which was laid upon some of his lands,
and by reason of his refusal was summoned
to the Exchequer. He appeared and answered
to the charge in November, 1637. He was defended
by the brilliant Oliver St. John and
Mr. Holborne. Solicitor General Littleton
and Attorney General Bankes conducted the
case for the crown.</p>

<p>The question upon which the case was
argued may be phrased as follows: “Whether
the king had a right on his own allegation of
public danger to require an inland county
to furnish ships, or a prescribed sum of money
by way of commutation, for the defense of
the kingdom?”<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The argument for Hampden
can be summed up under five heads:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The case
for the
defendant</div>

<p>I. The law and constitution of England
provide certain ordinary revenues for the
defense of the realm. These comprehend the
military forces provided by those holding
lands by military tenure; the liability of the
Cinque Ports and others holding similarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>to provide a quota of ships, by reason of their
tenure; the feudal and other revenues inherent
in the crown; the customs on wool and leather,
and tunnage and poundage, and other special
dues which were wont to be granted to the
king in time of danger.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>II. The law and constitution of England
provide certain extraordinary revenues when
the ordinary revenues should prove insufficient,
and for the defense of the realm. Chief
among these were the subsidies and aids
which were granted in Parliament. That
Parliament was the only body capable of
levying these charges was exhibited by the
fact that the kings of England were wont to
denominate their arbitrary exactions as
“loans” and “benevolences.”</p>

<p>III. The statutes of the realm provided in
most emphatic language that no tax should
be levied on the subject without the consent
of Parliament. The charter of the Conqueror,
Magna Carta, especially Confirmatio Cartarum
and De Tallagio non Concedendo, the statutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>passed subsequently under Edward III, and
more than all the others, the Petition of Right,
showed the utter illegality of the ship money.</p>

<p>IV. The citations by the crown of exactions
similar to the ship money did not demonstrate
the lawfulness of the demand; they merely
showed precedents of such a general levy.
The case must be decided by law, not by
precedents,&mdash;“<i>judicandum est legibus non exemplis</i>.”</p>

<p>V. In the present instance, the perils which
the king cited were insufficient to justify an
unusual demand for money. The precedent
of the arbitrary actions of Queen Elizabeth
at the time of the Armada could in no wise be
taken as a justification for so great an exercise
of the prerogative when the nation was at
peace with the world; the piratical acts of
Turkish corsairs or even the insolence of rival
neighbors could not be reckoned amongst
those imminent perils for which a Parliament
could provide too tardily.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">A judgment
for
the crown</div>

<p>The judgment was in favor of the crown
seven to five. Three of the minority based
their decision upon the particular rather than
on general grounds; Croke and Hutton, however,
denied the general contention of the
crown absolutely. Croke maintained that taxation
save by authority of Parliament is contrary
to the common law and to the statutes;
that the exaction could not be defended upon
the plea of imminent danger; and that the extension
to inland counties was not legal or
warranted by any legal precedent. The seven
judges whose opinions were favorable to the
king, upheld the prerogative of the crown as
against the legislative power of Parliament.
Sir John Finch, chief justice of the common
pleas, stated their attitude clearly. “No act
of Parliament,” he said, “can bar a king of his
regality, as that no lands should hold of him,
or bar him of the allegiance of his subjects or
the relative on his part, as trust and power
to defend his people; therefore acts of Parliament
to take away his royal power in the defense
of his kingdom are void; they are void
acts of Parliament to bind the king not to command
the subjects, their persons, and goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and I say their money too; for no acts of Parliament
make any difference.”<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The effect of this decision upon the minds
of the people was immediate; it changed the
payment of the ship money from a semi-voluntary
gift to the king into an extortion
enforced by him. Previously they had supposed
that the ship money was paid out of
sufferance, that if it became too heavy, an
appeal to the courts would be sufficient to
remove it; now they felt that the king had
them by the throat and could force them to
do as he willed. Never was there a clearer
issue; the king and his prerogative against
the commons and their long-developing rights;
the power of the king to levy taxes upon his
own arbitrary authority against taxation by
the will of the taxed as expressed in Parliament.</p>

<p>The Scottish rebellion of 1638 which was
waged for the defense of religious freedom, and
the interval of peace, beginning the 18th June,
1639, which was used by Scots and English
alike as a period of armament, proved too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>much for Charles’s irregular financial supply.
Reluctantly he called his Fourth Parliament,
commonly known as the Short Parliament,<span class="sidenote">The Short
Parliament,
1640</span> for
the 13th April, 1640. The assembly was,
strange to say, most moderate and loyal to
the king. Charles through the ex-Speaker
Sir John Finch, now Lord Keeper, asked for a
large supply immediately, saying that he would
listen to grievances afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The commons recalled instances wherein the
royal word had been broken, and preferred to
withhold supply until the end of the session,
according to their familiar habit. They proceeded
to inquire into the Hampden case,
and considered in detail the various occasions
upon which the law had been broken during
their eleven years’ recess. They appointed
a committee to confer with the lords over a
long list of grievances, divided into the three

of private property, and breaches of
parliamentary privilege.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> At this Charles
came forward with a gigantic piece of tactlessness;
thinking he saw a hole through
which he could escape, he tried to win the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>lords to his standard. Applying to them,
they voted and communicated to the House
of Commons that “his Majesty’s supply should
have the precedency, and be resolved on before
any other matter whatsoever.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> To the
commons this appeared an arrant breach of
privilege,<span class="sidenote">Clash between
the
Houses</span> it being their right that money bills
should originate in their House. The lords
immediately adopted a conciliatory tone; they
renounced any intention of offending the commons.
“The bill of subsidies,” they admitted,
“ought to have its inception and beginning in
your House; and that when it comes up to
their lordships, and is by them agreed unto,
it must be returned back to you and be by
your House presented.”<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>The king had reason to regret his intrusion
since the dispute which he had caused delayed
a supply from the commons so much the
more. He now had recourse to a compromise.
He offered the withdrawal of his claim to
ship money in consideration of a grant of
twelve subsidies,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> payable in three years.
The commons, perceiving that the proposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>if acceded to, involved the tacit admission
that the ship money had been justly
laid, insomuch as its removal was obtainable
only by purchase, refused to enter into the
agreement. But the effect of the message
was not quite lost; on the contrary it seemed
as though the king would shortly receive his
grant. At the moment when the commons
were on the point of deciding upon a supply,
the amount to be determined subsequently,
Sir Henry Vane, secretary of state, precipitated
a crisis. He asserted that the supply
would not be accepted unless it were to the
amount and in the manner designated in the
king’s message.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The next day, the 5th May,
the king dissolved his three-weeks-old Parliament,
to his own great distress and the trepidation
of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissolution
of
Parliament</div>

<p>Charles employed the six months which
intervened between the dissolution of Parliament
and the summons of the Long Parliament
in his usual occupations. He locked up
several members of the House. He exacted
forced loans, created new monopolies, and
levied ship money. Prosecutions followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>swiftly upon refusals to pay. “Coat and
conduct money,” a new exaction from the
counties, was demanded to cover the traveling
expenses of recruits on their way to fight
against the Scots. He obtained six subsidies
from the clergy whom he illegally kept in
convocation after the dissolution of Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sitting of
the Long
Parliament,
3rd
November,
1640</div>

<p>The wind of opposition was rising to a gale.
With the sitting of the Long Parliament, which
convened on the 3rd November, 1640, the
tempest broke. The immediate occasion of
the summons was the universal demand of
the people and the peers for a session of Parliament,
coupled with emptiness of the treasury
which came with the commencement of the
disastrous Scottish war. The composition of
the commons was overwhelmingly anti-regal;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
the popular leaders had been at work in the
counties ever since the dissolution of the Short
Parliament looking to the return of a strong
majority in opposition to the king. The assembly
convened full of the idea that “they
had now had an opportunity to make their
country happy by removing all grievances and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>pulling up the causes of them by the roots, if
all men would do their duties.”<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Parliament lost no time in setting about its
work. Proceedings were immediately instituted
looking to the impeachment of the Earl
of Strafford, Archbishop Laud, Finch, and
six of the judges who had figured in the ship
money case. Various victims of the tyrannical
jurisdiction of the Star Chamber were set at
liberty. The commons exhibited their uncompromising
hostility to the king by voting
assistance to their “brethren” the Scots, whose
army was in possession of much territory on
the English side of the border. They granted
them £25,000 a month as long as their stay in
England should be needful, and in addition
£300,000 as an indemnity.</p>

<p>With such acts of open opposition to the
king in process, it was natural that Parliament
should set itself to clean up all the abuses
which of recent times had crept into the
government. Its actions were not subversive
of the constitution; on the contrary it left
unassailed many prerogatives of the king.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
On the 22nd June, 1641, Parliament granted
to the king tunnage and poundage for a length
of time somewhat less than two months<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> and
in the same bill declared, “that it is and hath
been the ancient right of the subjects of this
realm, that no subsidy, custom, impost, or
other charge whatsoever ought or may be laid
or imposed upon any merchandise exported or
imported by subjects, denizens,<span class="sidenote">Royal
exaction of
tunnage
and
poundage
declared
illegal</span> or aliens without
common consent in Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The
Act prescribed also the punishment which
should be inflicted upon officers who in time to
come should exact payments not sanctioned by
Parliament. They were to “incur and sustain
the pains, penalties, and forfeitures ordained
and provided by the Statute of Provision and
Premunire made in the sixteenth year of
King Richard II, and shall also from thenceforth
be disabled during his life to see or implead
any person in any action real, mixed,
or personal, or in any court whatsoever.”
Thus was it enacted that tunnage and poundage
exacted by authority of the crown was illegal,
and protected merchants from being sued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>by the customs officers in case of refusal to pay
the unlawful imposition. The king received
tunnage and poundage by six subsequent acts
for short terms down to the 2nd July, 1642.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ship
Money
Act, 7th
August,
1641</div>

<p>Six weeks later, on the 7th August, 1641,
Parliament turned its attention toward the
matter of ship money. On that date it passed
an “Act for the declaring unlawful and void
the late proceedings touching Ship-Money,
and for the vacating of all records and process
concerning the same.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The act cites
the Hampden Case and others of a similar
nature and outlines the plea of the royal prerogative
as given in the extra-judicial opinion
of the judges. It condemns “all which writs
and proceedings” as being “utterly against
the law of the land.” In greater detail it
enacts “that the said charge imposed upon the
subject for the providing and furnishing of
ships commonly called ship money, and the
said extra-judicial opinion of the said justices
... and the said judgment against
John Hampden, were and are contrary to
and against the laws and statutes of this realm,
the right of property, the liberty of the subjects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>former resolutions in Parliament and the
Petition of Right.” The act also provided
that all particulars desired in the Petition of
Right should be “strictly holden and observed
as in the same Petition they are prayed and
expressed.” The ship writs and the Hampden
judgment are specifically annulled.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Thus came to an end the long chain of
statutes which Parliament from its inception
had been forging to fetter the arms of the king
straining toward the prize of arbitrary taxation.
The virtue of the Long Parliament is
thus commented upon by Hallam: “In the
first place,” he says, “it will appear ... that
they made scarce any material change in our
constitution, such as it had been established
and recognized under the house of Plantagenet....
Thus in by far the greater part
of the enactments of 1641, the monarchy lost
nothing that it anciently possessed; and the
balance of our constitution might seem rather
to have been restored to its former equipoise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>than to have undergone any change....
It is to be observed in the second place, that
by these salutary restrictions, and some new
retrenchments of pernicious or abused prerogative
the Long Parliament formed our constitution
such nearly as it now exists.”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The
legislation of 1641 in effect restored to Parliament
what power it nominally held two centuries
before.</p>

<p>A current of reaction now set in favorable to
the king. The leaders in the commons discovered
that the popular support to their
measures was becoming weak, that the royalist
party was recruiting adherents from the former
supporters of the opposition, that their own
backing was by a party, not by the nation.
With the hope of winning back full national
adherence to Parliament,<span class="sidenote">The
Grand
Remonstrance,
1st December,
1641</span> the Grand Remonstrance
was framed by the House of Commons
and presented to the king, on the 1st December
1641.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> It purported to show the present state
of the kingdom, the evil conditions which
Parliament had succeeded in bettering, and
the darkness of the future, if support were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>withdrawn from Parliament. With respect to
taxation, the Remonstrance recites the various
illegalities and abuses which the crown had
practiced and the steps which the commons
had taken to provide for their correction. For
future safeguard against their return it suggests
“that for the better preservation of the
liberties and laws, all illegal grievances and
exactions should be presented and punished at
the sessions and assizes; and that judges and
justices should be sworn to the due execution
of the Petition of Right and other laws.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Puritan
Revolution</div>

<p>With the delivery of the Grand Remonstrance,
the contest for Parliamentary taxation
became of relatively small moment in
the great conflicts of the Puritan Revolution.
The struggle over the impeachment of Pym
and the popular leaders in the House, the
attempt of the king to secure absolute command
of the militia, the battles on the field
and in the House of Commons during the
Civil War, the events which led up to the
execution of Charles&mdash;these were neither
immediately caused by the conflict over taxation
nor did they have immediate effect upon
it. Taxation up to 1641 was a prime cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
opposition to the crown; thereafter it ceased
to be of so great importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accession
of Charles
II, 1660</div>

<p>Charles II came to the throne in 1660 after
the English people had made an eleven years’
trial of a military despotism under a good
and moderate despot. His first Parliament,
that of 1660, granted him the proceeds of
the customs for life. During the period of the
Commonwealth, the freedom from the feudal
charges had been most agreeable to those
holding of the crown. Consequently, this
Parliament set itself to regulate the confused
system of military tenure by the simple expedient
of abolition. The Great Contract which
had been proposed under James I for the
same purpose, had been advocated in vain.
Now, however, the effort was successful. The
feudal incidents, such as wardships, marriages,
knight’s service, as well as the three feudal
aids, knighting the king’s son, ransoming the
king, and furnishing dowry for his eldest
daughter, were done away with. By this
great deprivation, the royal revenue was
naturally much prejudiced. Parliament made
up the loss by granting to the crown an hereditary
excise on beer and some other liquors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
increasing the royal revenue to the annual
value of £1,200,000.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Appropriation
of
supplies,
1665</div>

<p>In 1665 the expenses incident to the Dutch
War made it possible to establish a principle
which had been touched upon from time
to time since the days of Henry III. Sir
George Downing, in the subsidy bill of that
year, introduced the provision that the money
raised in accordance with the bill, £1,250,000,
be applicable solely to the prosecution of the
war, and that the money could not be paid
out by the Exchequer save by special warrant
stating that as the purpose of the payment.
Clarendon opposed the measure as an encroachment
upon the honor of the crown, but
Charles himself was not averse to it, mainly by
reason of his belief that the promised revenue
would be thus more acceptable to bankers as
the security for loans. The appointment in the
following year of a commission to examine the
public accounts in order to determine the faithfulness
with which the provision was carried
out, clinched the principle underlying its original
passage. The bill was the natural consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>of the liberty of appropriation enjoyed
under the Commonwealth. The exercise of
the principle of appropriating supplies in detail
was not carried to its full extent until after
1689. Its importance is difficult to overestimate.
It placed the executive power in a position
of perfect dependence upon the will of
Parliament, for the money requisite for any
administrative act was to be forthcoming only
in accordance with the previously expressed
intent of Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
James II,
1685-88</div>

<p>The reign of James II, who came to the
throne in 1685 at the death of Charles, was
retrogressive. He assumed the crown with
the full intention of exercising arbitrary authority,
and if he had not tried to substitute
Catholicism for the Established Church,
there is little to show that he would not at
least for a time have succeeded. Before
the summons of his Parliament, which he
called reluctantly notwithstanding a lapse of
five years under Charles without one, he continued
to himself the payment of the customs
duties by proclamation. This illegal act met
with no serious objection from Parliament
when it met. Nor was this all; Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
raised the permanent revenue of the king to
the annual amount of £2,000,000, and on
the suppression of Monmouth’s rebellion,
gave him £700,000 more wherewith to support
a standing army. Thus did Parliament
make James financially independent, provided
he was content to live within reason,
and gave him an army in addition. This was
a combination of powers which on the Continent
had sufficed to create despotisms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
and Mary</div>

<p>That it did not create a despotism in England
is not greatly to be wondered at. James
set himself to fighting the battle of the Roman
Catholic church in England. The result
was almost immediate disaster. On the 5th
November, 1688, William, Prince of Orange,
and Stadtholder of the United Provinces,
landed at Torbay in Devonshire. He was
requested by seventy of the lords spiritual
and temporal (all who were then in London),
by the members of the House of Commons
which met in the last Parliament of Charles II,
and the corporation of the City of London,
to assume the provisional government of the
kingdom pending a session of Parliament.
This was called for the 22nd January, 1688-89.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
On the 13th February following, a tender
of the crown was made to William, on the conditions
denominated in the recently framed
Declaration of Right. In it the illegal acts of
King James were recited and the announcement
was made that the throne had been abdicated;
it was asserted also that certain specified
acts of King James were illegal, and a
resolution was appended settling the crown on
William and Mary. William, speaking for
himself and for the Princess Mary, “thankfully
accepted what had been offered them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bill
of Rights,
1689</div>

<p>The Declaration of Right, with some slight
but essential changes, was incorporated at
the second session of this Parliament, the
25th October, 1689, in statutory form known
subsequently as the Bill of Rights.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> In the
matter of taxation, it sums up in a few clauses
the whole principle which had been in course
of evolution since the German chieftains
received gifts of cattle and fruits from their
people.</p>

<p>It states that King James “did endeavor
to subvert and extirpate ... the laws and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>liberties of this kingdom ... by levying
money for and to the use of the crown, by
pretense of prerogative, for other time and in
other manner than the same was granted by
Parliament.” Then follows the definite assertion,
“that levying money for or to the use
of the crown by pretense of prerogative,
without grant of Parliament for longer time
or in other manner than the same is or shall
be granted, is illegal.” The clause which
gave to these statements the force of law,
emphasizes the power of Parliament. “All
which their Majesties are contented and
pleased,” so it goes, “shall be declared, enacted,
and established by authority of this present
Parliament, and shall stand, remain, and
be the law of this realm forever; and the same
are by their said Majesties, by and with the
advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and
temporal, and Commons, in Parliament assembled,
and by the authority of the same,
declared, enacted and established accordingly.”</p>

<p>With the passing of the Bill of Rights the
principle was vindicated in its fullness that
Parliament rather than the crown has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
power to tax. Within Parliament itself the
power of laying taxes had undergone further
differentiation in that the House of Commons
claimed the sole right of initiating tax levies.
The theory deduced therefrom, that the
House of Commons has sole control over
money bills and that interference by the House
of Lords is an assumption of power beyond
the constitutional rights of that House, came
up for fuller definition 220 years later. The
corollary principle that Parliament has the
power to appropriate supplies for specific purposes
and that it can demand an accounting
for the money so appropriated were accorded
general acquiescence then and thereafter.</p>

The <i>heriot</i>, unlike the feudal incident known to the
Normans as a <i>relief</i>, was a repayment to the king upon the
death of a vassal, of the various accoutrements with which
he had been endowed. The statute of Cnut II, § 72, fixes
the heriot of an earl at eight horses, four suits of armor, and
two hundred mancuses of gold. The heriot varied in amount
according to the rank of the deceased vassal. The statute
is given in Stubbs, <i>Select Charters</i>, 74.</p>

taxes.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A. 1104. It is not easy to describe the misery of this land,
which it suffered at this time through the various and manifold
oppressions and taxes that never ceased or slackened.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A. 1105. This was a year of great distress from the failure
of the fruits, and from the manifold taxes which never ceased.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A. 1110. This was a year of much distress from the taxes
which the king raised for his daughter’s dowry.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A. 1118. England paid dearly for all this (i. e., the Norman
war) by the manifold taxes which ceased not all this year.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A. 1124. Full heavy a year was this; he who had any
property was bereaved of it by heavy taxes and assessments,
and he who had none, starved with hunger.</p>

Bishop Stubbs (1 <i>Const. Hist. Eng.</i> 500) believes this
struggle between Henry II and Becket to have been the deathblow
to the levy of the Danegeld, which is not noted in the
Pipe Rolls after 1163. J. H. Round [<i>Feudal England</i>, 497-502,
in the paper “The Alleged Dispute on Danegeld (1163)”],
effectually establishes his contention that the tax in question
was not the Danegeld, but the “auxilium vicecomitis” or
“Sheriff’s aid,” which was a customary, variable charge paid
over locally to the sheriffs in payment for their services.</p>

The Danegeld disappears from the Rolls in 1163. It
persists, probably, however, as a “donum” or an “auxilium.”

Beside the instances of taxation cited above, Richard exacted
from the tenants of the royal demesne a tax upon movables
known as <i>tallage</i>. It was semi-feudal in nature, being
taken from the dwellers on land held immediately of the king,
and consequently the authority of the tax for the time was
far beyond question, save as the turbulent elements in the
urban populations might assume it as a pretext for a riot.
Henry II levied this tax in 1168, 1173; Richard in 1189 and
1194, and probably upon other occasions. These are the only
references to tallages in the Rolls of these two reigns. The
term appears frequently in later records.</p>

2 Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist. Eng.</i> 30, note 1. He bases his
belief on the fact that “the orders for the collecting this scutage
were issued Feb. 22, the same day on which the writs for
proclaiming the charters are dated,” and cites 1 <i>Rot. Claus.</i>
377. In the same note he records the following instances of
taxation:</p>
<p class="pfc4">“June 7, 1217, the king mentions a carucage, hidage and
aid, ‘quod de præcepto nostro assisum est.’ 1 <i>Rot. Claus.</i>
310.”</p>

<p class="pfc4">“Jan. 17, Henry mentions a scutage of two marks on the

<p class="pfc4">1245. Grant of an aid of 20 shillings “ad filiam maritandam.”
1 Madox, <i>Hist. Ex.</i> 594.</p>
<p class="pfc4">1246. Scutage of three marks on the fee. 2 Stubbs, <i>Const.

<p class="pfc4">1248. Noted above.</p>
<p class="pfc4">1249. Appointment of justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer
demanded. Failure. 2 Matt. Par. <i>Chron. Maj.</i> trans. Giles,
308-309.</p>
<p class="pfc4">1252. The Pope held Henry to his promise of a Crusade
made in 1250, and authorized him to exact a tenth of the
revenues of the clergy for three years. The clergy delayed.
Henry turned to the barons and asked for a scutage; the barons
answered that their reply would depend upon the prelates.
2 Matt. Par. <i>Chron. Maj.</i> trans. Giles, 518-527.</p>
<p class="pfc4">1253. Debate on the above. At last Henry obtained his
tenth from the clergy and an aid of 3 marks from the tenants-in-chief
for the knighting of his son. The condition was the
confirmation of the Charters, and a great oath for his faithful
observance of them. 3 Matt. Par. <i>Chron. Maj.</i> trans. Giles,

Wool, hides and leather formed the bulk of the early
exports from England. Wine was the principal import. It
was on these articles of merchandise, and such others as the
merchants brought in and took out, that duties had been
charged since early times. The taxes had become customary
and were spoken of as “consuetudines,” or customs. The
basis for the exaction was the understanding that the merchants,
most of them foreigners, should be given protection
by the king. The early prisage on wine amounted to one
cask from every cargo of from ten to twenty casks, arriving
at a port of England. From ships carrying more than twenty
casks, two casks were exacted. Sometimes the duty instead
of being made in wine was compounded for in money. The
amount of the export tax on wool in the beginning is not
known. In merchandise of other sorts, the payment amounted
to a tenth or a fifteenth of the value of the goods.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Magna Carta abolished illegal exactions on goods retaining
only the “ancient and lawful customs” above mentioned.
Taxable commodities were wine, wool, and general merchandise.
In many instances, in spite of the prohibitions in the
Charter, the customs amounted to confiscation. Until the
time of Edward I there was unending irregularity in the
management of the customs. Merchant strangers, by Cap.
41 of the Great Charter were to have “safe and secure exit
from England, and entry to England ... buying and selling
by the ancient and right customs, quit from all evil Tolls.”</p>

The character of this tax, indeed its very existence, is
questioned. Matthew of Westminster (422), mentions a tax
on the towns of “the sixth penny.” It may have been either
a tallage or a tax by special negotiation, or it may have been
granted by the shire representatives on the theory that the
towns were included within their shires, though this is most
unlikely. See Taswell-Langmead, <i>Eng. Const. Hist.</i> 199;

In the fourteenth century the clergy ceased to act in Parliament.
They preferred to make their grants in separate convocations,
and continued to do so until 1664 when they were
merged with the other two estates. From the reign of
Henry VIII, the grants of the clergy were subject to parliamentary
confirmation. Taswell-Langmead, <i>Eng. Const. Hist.</i>

The bull “Clericis laicos,” published 24th February,
1296, by Boniface VIII, was levelled at the taxation of the
clergy by temporal powers; it prohibited the clergy from paying
and the secular powers from receiving contributions by
way of taxes, under pain of excommunication. The bull is
given in 1 Rymer, <i>Foedera</i>, part 3, p. 156, and in Adams

“Clericis laicos,” it will be remembered, prohibited
compliance by the clergy with demands by the crown for
taxation. It is evident that a gift by the clergy for the defense
of the realm, provided it be not a compliant, but an initial
act, was not a contravention of the bull.</p>

Edward, despite the ordinance banishing Gaveston, in
January, 1312, recalled him. But the restoration was fatal to
the favorite. Thomas of Lancaster intercepted him on his
way back to London and murdered him. Gaveston was
avenged, however, in 1322, when Edward for the moment
securing the upper hand, took Lancaster and beheaded him.</p>

Other instances of taxation during the reign were: 1313,
October. Parliament grants a tax on movables,&mdash;the barons
and knights a twentieth and the towns a fifteenth. Grant
made in consequence of a general pardon issued by Edward.
1 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 448. Cf. Thom. Walsingham, <i>Hist. Anglicana</i>,
ed. 1 Riley, 136. 1315, Jan.-March. King put on an allowance
of £10 a day. The clergy grant a tenth on certain conditions,
the towns a fifteenth and the barons and knights a
twentieth. 2 Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist. Eng.</i> 355, and citations.
1316. Towns grant a fifteenth, the knights and barons offer
a soldier to be supported by each township, and the clergy
express their willingness to contribute a tenth in their own
convocations. 1 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 450-451. 2 Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist.
Eng.</i> 356. The grant of a soldier was afterward compounded
for by a grant of a sixteenth. 1319. The towns grant a twelfth,
the barons and knights an eighteenth. 1 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 454-455.
1320. No taxes, save a clerical tenth, granted by the Pope.
2 Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist. Eng.</i> 363, note 2. 1322. Clergy grant a
tenth for 2 years. Knights and barons grant a man-at-arms
from each township for 40 days. Commuted by money payment.

In 1334 the fifteenth and tenth was compounded for by
a fixed sum, rather than in accordance with a strict assessment.
Hereafter each town and each county knew for how much it
would have to answer. The expression was the fiscal equivalent
of £39,000, less about £6,000 for decayed towns. 1 Dowell,

The taxes during the reign in summary:&mdash;Parliament of
October, 1377. Two tenths and two fifteenths. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i>
7. Parliament of October, 1378. An increase of custom on
wool and merchandise over the grant to Edward III in 1376.
3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 37. Parliament of April, 1379 (another session
of the last Parliament). Superseded the above tax on wool,
which had proven to be insufficient, with a graduated poll-tax
which varied according to the position of the taxpayer. A
tax of a groat a head had been levied in 1377, but this was the
first instance of a poll-tax of varied incidence. The payments:
The Dukes of Lancaster and Bretagne, ten marks each; earls
or their widows, four pounds; barons and baronets, two
pounds; and so on down to persons of the lowest rank, who
were to pay a groat apiece. (Further details, 1 Dowell, <i>Taxation
and Taxes</i>, 94.) Proceeds were to be strictly for national
defense. Produced about half as much as was expected, only
£22,000. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 57-58, 72-73. Parliament of 1380. A
tenth and a half and a fifteenth and a half with a year’s subsidy
on wool. A second Parliament, finding this amount
insufficient, in the same year undertook to raise the “outrageous
and intolerable” amount, £160,000. The means was
another graduated poll-tax, varying from sixty groats to three,
together with a continuance of the subsidy on wool, a custom
which netted about £60,000 annually. The clergy undertook
to raise their share of the money. The poll-tax was expected to
bring about £66,000. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 75, 90. Parliament of
1382. A fifteenth and a tenth, to be devoted wholly to the
defense of the realm. Tunnage and poundage for two years.
3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 124, 134. Parliaments of 1383. Grant of fifteenth
and tenth made in 1382, given to Bishop of Norwich
who was warring against the anti-pope in Flanders. He was
held to account at the October session. Two half tenths and
two half fifteenths were granted by the commons, one-half
without condition, and the other half for the prosecution of
the war if it be prolonged. Clergy made similar grants. 3 <i>Rot.
Parl.</i> 151-152. Parliament of 1384. At spring session half a
tenth and fifteenth. At fall session, two tenths and fifteenths,
one of which was remitted the following spring. The object
was the prosecution of a war in Scotland. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 167,
185, 398. Parliament of 1385. Granted a fifteenth and a half
and a tenth and a half. Wool subsidy renewed for another
year. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 204. Parliament of 1386. Half a tenth and
fifteenth, with duplication if exigencies of war demanded.
Continuance of subsidy on wool and merchandise, the object
being for naval defense. Before Richard could obtain this
grant, he had to consent to the appointment of a commission
of reform to correct the irregularities in the realm and in his
household. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 220-221. Parliaments of 1388.
First session. Half a tenth and fifteenth with tunnage and
poundage and the custom on wool. From the subsidy on wool
£20,000 is awarded to the “Lords Appellant,” who had
brought charges against the royal favorites upon which they
were convicted and punished. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 244-245. The
increase of custom on wool is forbidden. Fall session. A tenth
and a fifteenth. 2 Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist. Eng.</i> 505, note 3, and
citations. Parliament of 1390. Subsidy on wool and merchandise.
3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 278. Parliament of 1391. A fifteenth
and a half and a tenth and a half. Above subsidy on wool and
merchandise renewed for three years at an increased rate.
3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 285-286. Parliament of 1393. Grant on wool and
merchandise for three years. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 301. Parliament of
1394. Tunnage and poundage. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 314. Parliament
of 1395. Fifteenth and tenth. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 330. Parliament
of 1397. Custom on wool for five years. Tunnage and poundage
for three years. Protest registered against the extravagance
of the court. 3 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 340. Parliament of 1398. A
tenth and a half and a fifteenth and a half. A subsidy on wool,
woolfells, and leather for the term of Richard’s life. 3 <i>Rot.
Parl.</i> 368.</p>

In 1472 was a marked departure from the rule. A grant
regularly enacted, appropriating revenue and income of the
commons, was changed by the lords to include a tax on their
own property. 6 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 4-8. The good intent of the act,
justified in the eyes of contemporaries, apparently, its irregularity.</p>

1 Rich. III, c. 2.&mdash;“The king remembering how the Commons
of this his realm by new and unlawful inventions and
inordinate covetousness, against the law of this realm, have
been put to great thraldom and importable charges and exactions,
and in especial by a new imposition named a benevolence,
whereby divers years the subjects and Commons of this
land against their wills and freedom have paid great sums of
money to their almost utter destruction; for divers and many
worshipful men of this realm by occasion thereof were compelled
by necessity to break up their households and to live
in great penury and wretchedness. Their debts unpaid and
their children unpreferred, and such memorials as they had
ordained to be done for the wealth of their souls were made
void and annulled, to the great displeasure of God and to the
destruction of this realm; therefore the king will it be ordained,
by the advice and assent of his Lords spiritual and temporal
and the Commons of this present Parliament assembled, and
by the authority of the same, that his subjects and the commonalty
of this his realm from henceforth in no wise be
charged by none such charge or imposition called benevolence,
nor by such like charge; and that such exactions called benevolences,
afore this time taken be taken for no example to
make such or any like charge of any his said subjects of this
realm hereafter, but it be dampned and annulled forever.”

The sections which concern taxation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">Humbly show unto our Sovereign Lord the King, the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament assembled,
that whereas it is declared and enacted by a statute
made in the reign of King Edward the First, commonly
called, <i>Statutum de tallagio non concedendo</i>, that no tallage
or aid shall be laid or levied by the king or his heirs in this
realm, without the good-will and assent of the Archbishops,
Bishops, Earls, Barons, Knights, Burgesses, and other freemen
of the commonalty of this realm; and by authority of
Parliament holden in the five and twentieth year of the reign
of King Edward the Third, it is declared and enacted, that
from thenceforth no person shall be compelled to make any
loans to the king against his will, because such loans were
against reason and the franchise of the land; and by other
laws of this realm it is provided, that none should be charged
by any charge or imposition, called a Benevolence, nor by
such like charge, by which the statutes before mentioned,
and the other the good laws and statutes of this realm, your
subjects have inherited this freedom, that they should not
be compelled to contribute to any tax, tallage, aid, or other
like charge, not set by common consent in Parliament:</p>
<p class="pfc4">Yet nevertheless, of late divers commissions directed to
sundry commissioners in several counties with instructions
have issued, by pretext whereof your people have been in divers
places assembled, and required to lend certain sums of money
unto your Majesty, and many of them upon their refusal so
to do, have had an unlawful oath administered unto them,
not warrantable by the laws and statutes of this realm, and
have been constrained to become bound to make appearance
and give attendance before your Privy Council, and in other
places; and others of them have been therefore imprisoned,
confined, and sundry other ways molested and disquieted:
and divers other charges have been laid and levied upon
your people in several counties, by Lords Lieutenants, Deputy
Lieutenants, Commissioners for Musters, Justices of the Peace
and others, by command or direction from your Majesty or
your privy Council, against the laws and free customs of
this realm....</p>
<p class="pfc4">And whereas of late great companies of soldiers and marines
have been dispersed into divers counties of the realm, and
the inhabitants against their wills have been compelled to
receive them into their houses, and there to suffer them to
sojourn, against the laws and customs of the realm, and to
the great grievance and vexation of the people....</p>
<p class="pfc4">They do therefore humbly pray your most Excellent Majesty,
that no man hereafter be compelled to make or yield
any gift, loan, benevolence, tax, or such like charge, without
common consent by Act of Parliament; and that none be
called to make answer, or take such oath, or to give attendance,
or be confined, or otherwise molested or disquieted
concerning the same, or for refusal thereof; ... and that
your Majesty will be pleased to remove the said soldiers and
marines, and that your people may not be burdened in time
to come. 2 <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 374-6. The Petition of Right may

<p class="pfc4">The “parchments in the Tower” might readily have included
the following, which exhibits an historical precedent
for the ship money:</p>
<p class="pfc4">“1008. Rex Anglorum Aegelredus de ccc. x. cassatis
unam trierem, de novem vero loricam et cassidem fieri, et
per totam Angliam naves intente praecipit fabricari.” 1 Florentii
Wigorniensis Monachi, <i>Chronicon ex Chronicis</i>, 160.</p>
<p class="pfc4">1 Freeman, <i>Norman Conquest</i>, 647, note LL., cites 3 <i>Codex
Diplomaticus</i>, 351, to show that before 1008 a levy of
ships was not unknown. Archbishops Aelfric upon his death
gave to the people of Wiltshire and Kent a ship. Wiltshire
is an inland county. It is justifiable, then, to believe that “per
totam Angliam” may be taken literally, and that Ethelred
really exacted a ship from every 310 hides throughout England.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
